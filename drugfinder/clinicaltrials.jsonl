FXS and CTD affect hemizygous males and with highly variable severity heterozygous females. Both these neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have a dramatic impact on the family quality of life and the health-care system. These disorders share common clinical traits, including intellectual disability, autistic-like features, behavioural and mood alterations and seizures. Brain anatomy appears largely normal, suggesting that functional deficits result from subtle changes in synaptic connectivity. Moreover, common physiological mechanisms related to brain energetics might concur to the pathophysiology of FXS and CTD. Indeed, FMR1 and SLC6A8 are directly involved in the regulation of metabolism and the loss-of-function of both genes leads to a disruption of the mitochondrial network.\n\nThere is no cure for these disorders and the efficacy study of potential treatments is hindered by the scarcity of unbiased, quantitative, non-invasive biomarkers for monitoring brain function.\n\nThis is a critical problem, since the often-used phenotypic observation of behavioural endpoints to score NDDs such as FXS and CTD is highly prone to subjective bias. For successful clinical trials, the availability of objective readouts is crucial to evaluate the therapeutic response to new drugs. There are multiple techniques to visualize neural circuit activity in the living brain. Interestingly, FXS and CTD are the only two NDDs that at preclinical level show an abnormally large hemodynamic response to sensory stimulation in functional imaging studies of intrinsic optical signals.\n\nThe objective of this project is to exploit optical imaging techniques to devise a measurable and non-invasive biomarker of brain function in FXS and CTD. Since a disruption of brain energy metabolism is a major disease mechanism linking these disorders, we hypothesized that the assessment of the cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption represents a sensitive readout for quantifying functional alterations of neural circuits.\n\nFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), allows quantifying changes of hemoglobin species and local blood flow in the cerebral cortex of humans, providing an indirect measure of neuronal activity. In the clinical framework, this blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal is similar to that detected with functional MRI (fMRI). However, fNIRS has the advantage of being completely non-invasive, low-cost, portable, noiseless, endowed with high experimental flexibility and easy to implement in both laboratory and clinical settings. Moreover, fNIRS is more tolerant to motion artifacts than fMRI, and robust methods for motion detection/correction allow to image very young children without sedation. These methodological strengths make fNIRS as an outstanding choice for investigating neural circuits in clinically relevant populations at the very-low cost. Although introduced into the clinical care almost 40 years ago, fNIRS gained much popularity in the study of brain development and NDDs only recently. To date, however, fNIRS has been used primarily to investigate the typical maturation of speech perception and language, sensory and motor functions, social communication and interaction, object and action processing in toddlers and children.\n\nIn this proposal, the investigators hypothesize that by combining the above-mentioned strengths of fNIRS to the clinical study of several cognitive and motor parameters, the investigators can define unique \"fNIRS signatures\" for FXS and CTD as brain biomarkers for the diagnosis and the assessment of treatment outcomes. Since the measurement of visual responses has been introduced as a quantitative method to assess brain function in NDDs, the investigators will test the value of visually-evoked fNIRS signals in classifying patients and predicting symptom severity in the FXS and CTD clinical population. Preliminary data in the mouse models of CTD and FXS strongly suggest that visual hemodynamic responses (vHDR) are markedly altered in the occipital cortex of mutant animals. Morever, the investigators will use a standardized procedure with high entertaining value to measure vHDR in the occipital cortex of children."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Fragile X Syndrome (FXS)", "Creatine Transporter Deficiency"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Clinical assessment", "description": "Clinical examination including Medical history, developmental trajectory, epilepsy history, ASD symptoms, clinical examination at the inclusion visit by a neuropediatrist", "armGroupLabels": ["CTD (Creatine Transporter Deficiency ) patients", "Chronological age-matched controls", "FXS (Fragile X Syndrome) patients"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Parental questionnaires", "description": "Parental questionnaires including Vineland-2, ABC, CBCL, PPD-MRS, SRS-2 and BRIEF completed at the inclusion visit", "armGroupLabels": ["CTD (Creatine Transporter Deficiency ) patients", "Chronological age-matched controls"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Cognitive assessment", "description": "Cognitive assessment including Leiter-3, PPVT 5, EVT 3 completed at the inclusion visit", "armGroupLabels": ["CTD (Creatine Transporter Deficiency ) patients", "Chronological age-matched controls"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Reasoning assessment", "description": "Simple reasoning tasks on tablets performed at the inclusion visit.", "armGroupLabels": ["CTD (Creatine Transporter Deficiency ) patients", "Chronological age-matched controls", "FXS (Fragile X Syndrome) patients"]}, {"type": "DEVICE", "name": "fNIRS assessement", "description": "Imaging session using fNIRS (NIRSport 8x8, NIRx Medical Technologies LLC, Berlin, Germany) performed at the inclusion visit.", "armGroupLabels": ["CTD (Creatine Transporter Deficiency ) patients", "Chronological age-matched controls", "FXS (Fragile X Syndrome) patients"]}]}}}

The prevalence of PAD in European population studies ranged from 3.6 to 9.2 % and 10-20 % in those aged over 70 years \\[4\\]. In a recent meta-analysis, the prevalence of PAD in China increased gradually by age until mid-60s, after which the increase accelerated. In the early stages, PAD is mostly silent. With the progression of disease, it may manifest as intermittent claudication, pain at rest, non-healing ulcer and gangrene resulting in lower-extremity amputation \\[5\\]. PAD is a major cause of disability, loss of employment, and lifestyle changes, and is a marker for systemic atherosclerotic diseases. Patients with symptomatic PAD have at least a 30% risk of death within 5 years rising to almost 50% within 10 years, resulting primarily from myocardial infarction or stroke \\[4\\]. Despite the major health risks associated with PAD, it is generally not recognized by clinicians or the general public in comparison with other cardiovascular diseases. However, asymptomatic individuals also have higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events similar to those with symptomatic PAD \\[6\\]. Many studies have shown that public awareness of PAD is much lower than that of other diseases. It has been reported that awareness of PAD ranged from 20 to 36 %, whereas awareness of other common diseases was more than 60 % in the same population \\[6-9\\]. Awareness is important for patients and physicians, and the need for public awareness programs has been highlighted \\[10, 11\\]. There is paucity of published literature on public awareness of PAD in Asian countries. It is difficult to reduce the morbidity and mortality of untreated PAD without adequate public awareness of PAD and its risk factors and consequences \\[7\\]. Insights into public awareness of PAD will help in developing strategies for behavioral change communication and health promotion.

The procedure is similar to a bone marrow transplant, in that the patient's malfunctioning blood stem cells are reduced or eliminated using chemotherapy, but it is different because instead of using a different person's (donor) blood stem cells for the transplant, the patient's own blood stem cells are given back after the new genetic material has been introduced into those cells. This approach has the advantage of eliminating any risk of Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), reducing the risk of graft rejection, and may also allow less chemotherapy to be utilized for the conditioning portion of the transplant procedure.

These mutations target specific amino acids, at positions 140 or 172 of IDH2, and 132 of IDH1. Mutant IDH proteins acquire an abnormal enzymatic activity allowing them to convert \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) into D-2 hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), an oncometabolite which massively accumulates in IDH-mutated cells. At high levels, D-2HG behaves as a competitive inhibitor of \u03b1KG and affects the activity of Fe(II)/\u03b1KG-dependent dioxygenases. This enzymatic family is involved in a broad spectrum of pathways such as demethylation of histone (JHDM histone demethylases) or DNA (methylcytosine hydroxylases of the TET family). As a result, IDH-mutated cells show altered survival, motility, invasiveness and cell differentiation. In AML, IDH1 mutations might be present in 10-15% at diagnosis\n\nIvosidenib (IVO) a first-in-class, oral, irreversible inhibitor of mutant IDH1 has shown clinical activity as a single agent in studies involving patients with IDH1 mutated relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML and in front line settings. In phase II clinical trials, IVO yielded 30-35% of complete response rates both in frontline and R/R settings, with long lasting responses. Based on these results, the FDA (Food and Drug Agency) gave its approval for newly-diagnosed AML IDH1mut patients who are \u2265 75 years old or who have comorbidities and in R/R. However, European Medicines Agency (EMA)'s did not approved IVO due to lack of evidences to support the application. Agios Netherlands B.V.

This high rate results from the recent democratization of high-risk sports, as well as an aging population with increased risks of falling. Aside from the resulting reduced physical activity, the social and professional impact of these fractures is undeniable and represents significant costs for our health care system. A recently published prospective case series reports 28 job losses out of 41 patients treated.\n\nThe clinical outcome of these patients depends mainly on the primary stability provided by the surgical treatment, after the greatest anatomical reduction possible. Indeed, Giannoudis and al. have demonstrated that under simple X-rays, the smaller the detected step-off, the better the outcome.The aim is to allow for recovery of good joint mobility to promote rapid resumption of activity and to limit the onset of early osteoarthritis.\n\nThe classical technique used for reduction and osteosynthesis of tibial plateau fractures (open surgical technique using a bone tamp) has several pitfalls : devascularization of the bone and skin, risks of infection and functional rehabilitation difficulties with delayed recovery of weight bearing. Moreover, this technique does not allow for the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of other possible lesions, such as meniscal injuries in particular.\n\nSince 2011, Poitiers University Hospital is offering to its patients a new minimally invasive technique for the reduction and stabilization of tibial plateau fractures, baptized \"Tibial Tuberoplasty\". The concept derives from the divergent use of vertebral kyphoplasty, initially dedicated for spinal injuries and transposed here to the tibial plateau. This technique involves expansion of the tibial plateau through inflation of a kyphoplasty balloon, filling of the created cavity with cement (PMMA, calcium phosphate) and percutaneous screw fixation.\n\nOrthopaedic surgeons of Poitiers University Hospital performed the first tibial tuberoplasties through a feasibility study on 36 cadaveric subjects and then transposed the technique to human. Surgeons identified major advantages such as minimal skin damage, possible treatment of posterior and multi-fragmented compressions (lifting in a single block by the balloon), reinforcement of the stability of the assembly using cement, possible use of combined arthroscopy (for concomitant meniscal injuries treatment).\n\nThis technique allows for optimization of the fracture reduction by elevating the posterior fragments with the inflatable bone tamp through an anterior approach. The reduction is made possible thanks to the specificity of the inflatable bone tamp which inflates and reduces the area of least resistance.\n\nThe aim of this innovative technique is focused on the anatomical reduction in order to restore the convexity of the tibial plateau which is similar to the balloon convexity.\n\nThe results from the first 40 patients operated since 2011 are promising and show a proportion of 70% presenting less than 5 mm step-off reduction. A larger scale multicenter randomized controlled trial is now requested to further demonstrate the superiority of the \"Tibial Tuberoplasty\" to the standard treatment.\n\nThe coordinator investigator designed this study to evaluate the quality of tibial fracture reduction offered by percutaneous \"Tibial Tuberoplasty\" versus conventional open surgery for tibial plateau fracture but also its impact on clinical outcome."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Schatzker Type 2 or 3 Tibial Plateau Fracture"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Tibial Tuberoplasty", "description": "Kyphoplasty ballon", "armGroupLabels": ["Experimental group"]}, {"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Open technique", "description": "Cutaneous incision with submeniscal arthrotomy under guidance of a fluoroscope.", "armGroupLabels": ["Control group"]}]}}}

Specifically, the study will re-validate eye vergence by comparing response patterns among three groups: cognitively healthy older adults, individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and patients with confirmed AD, based on blood biomarkers (\u00dfA40, \u00dfA42, pTau181, and pTau217).

Veteran suicide rates exceed those of the general population, with the disorder creating a mental health challenge that is costly and debilitating. The majority of Veterans with PTSD also have comorbid mental health diagnoses, such as generalized anxiety disorder, substance abuse disorder, and major depression. The treatment of Veteran PTSD and comorbid disorders represents an important therapeutic and rehabilitation problem. The disorder is complex and difficult to treat, with high treatment dropout and nonresponse rates spurring some Veterans to seek complementary integrative health strategies. One promising complementary strategy is the provision of a trained service dog. Initial evidence across multiple research groups highlights service dogs as a promising complement to evidence-based practices that can offer short-term improvements. However, the long-term effectiveness, mechanisms of action, and moderators of efficacy remain largely unknown. Thus, the overarching objective of this proposal is to understand how, why, and for whom PTSD service dogs are most effective.\n\nTo address this objective, the present project will assess the longitudinal efficacy and dose-response curve of service dogs for Veteran PTSD symptomology and psychosocial functioning. The research design will consist of a two-arm, randomized clinical trial (RCT) with longitudinal assessments over a period of 15 months. Results are expected to elucidate the clinical impact of service dogs for military Veterans with PTSD, as well as the biobehavioral mechanisms of action and characteristics that moderate efficacy.

Although the FDA has restricted use of descriptors such as \"natural\" and \"additive-free,\" research shows that the tobacco industry quickly pivoted to increase use of alternative, unregulated tactics. Greenwashing is one increasingly common tobacco marketing strategy in which products are portrayed as eco-friendly and/or natural. The investigators' preliminary research indicates that greenwashing tactics may inaccurately convey modified product risk to consumers. The overarching objective of this project is to test the effect of greenwashing methods used by cigarette companies to market products on actual smoking behavior in a controlled laboratory study. The investigators' proposed research focuses on young adults (age 18-29), because this is a key age for smoking initiation and escalation, and research has found that young adults may be more susceptible than older adults to greenwashing in cigarette ads. This study will test the effect of greenwashing on behavioral economic demand and smoking topography in a laboratory-controlled cigarette self-administration study. These data will clearly connect tobacco advertising features to product risk perceptions and actual smoking behavior. This work will provide FDA with an integrated set of evidence that identifies misleading greenwashing tactics that inaccurately convey modified product risk which can be used to inform regulatory action regarding restrictions of this type of advertising."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Tobacco Smoking"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Smoking sessions", "description": "Participants undergo topography and behavioral economic sessions where they can make choices to earn cigarette puffs by pulling plungers on experimental equipment", "armGroupLabels": ["Smoking sessions"]}]}}}

Ketchum University"}}, "descriptionModule": {"briefSummary": "The benefits of artificial tears to relieve dry eye symptoms include, but are not limited to: stabilizing the tear film layer, fluid supplement action, improving visual acuity, and comfort. Studies have found a relationship between some of these benefits. For example, stabilization of the tear film is important not only to increase the tear break up time (TBUT), but is key in improving and maintaining visual acuity. These studies have alluded to the fact that there may or may not be a relationship between residence time and visual performance. Viscosity is one reason behind the uncertainty. Some solutions contain polymers which influence the ocular surface when contacted. This can impact residence time and ultimately visual performance. No prior research has explored the direct relationship between residence time and visual performance.\n\nResidence time refers to the duration at which the artificial tear resides on the eye. Methods have been developed to assess residence time by admixing fluorescent tracers to the solution and then measuring the amount of fluorescence over time. The caveat to methods using certain tracers has lead to uncertainty in elimination measurements due to corneal penetration or differing molecular weights (MW) from the active vehicle ingredient in the solution. For example, low-MW tracers can be eliminated at a different rate than higher-MW polymers. In addition, the low-MW tracers may be able to penetrate the corneal epithelium giving a false pre-corneal residence time. Meadows, Paugh, Joshi, and Mordaunt addressed this issue by developing a technique using a polymer which did not penetrate the cornea and had the same MW as the active ingredient in the solution FITC-dextran. Based on the assumption that similar weights are eliminated at the same rate, this technique has shown to be more economic, manageable, and amendable than previous procedures measuring residence time.\n\nAny ophthalmic drop has the potential to impact visual acuity upon instillation due to the effect it has on the tear layer components. Studies have observed that taking artificial tears continuously over time tends to stabilize the tear layer thus minimizing the immediate drop in contrast sensitivity upon instillation. Measuring the visual effect of artificial tears, using contrast sensitivity as a measure, provides valuable information about the therapeutic effect of artificial tears that are meant to stabilize the tear film, thus improving visual acuity in dry eye patients.\n\nBut what about the patient? There is a difference between residence time and retention of effect- which is often what matters the most for patients. Retention of effect refers to the beneficial effect of the drop. Currently there is no real measure of retention of effect. Doctors can assess the tear film objectively, but there have been no strong correlations between subjective dry symptoms and tear film stability. A possible reason for the lack of correlation may be due to the fact that subjectivity is difficult to quantify. However, scales like the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) have been established in an attempt to quantify subjective experiences such as visual quality. We will be using the NRS to gauge the comfort of the drop upon the initial application to get a general idea of the comfort the drop provides to the user.\n\nAlthough there have been several studies done on residence time and visual effect of ophthalmic formulations separately, there is no current research correlating these two aspects of therapeutic efficacy. This study will be the first to concurrently investigate residence time (using FITC-dextran) and visual effect of an ophthalmic formulation."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Dry Eye Disease"]}, "designModule": {}, "armsInterventionsModule": {}}}

Internalizing disorders (ID), primarily depression and anxiety, are highly prevalent among youth receiving community-based treatment for substance use disorder (SUD). Comorbidity rates range from 30-70% due to the multiple developmental pathways by which adolescent SUD and ID cause and exacerbate one another. Moreover, unresolved ID issues significantly interfere with youth SUD treatment and recovery processes. Yet, the youth SUD clinical workforce is not systematically educated or trained in evidence-based practices for ID; thus, line services for youth SUD do not systematically target ID. The research literature offers a few integrated behavioral models for simultaneously treating both SUD and ID in youth; however, such models feature intensive manualized procedures that have proven cumbersome to scale and deliver in frontline settings. As a result, the clinical workforce, though desiring ID-focused training, currently has inadequate resources for treating ID effectively.\n\nA promising solution to diminish this quality gap is developing an adjunctive, modular protocol to augment routine care for comorbid SUD/ID by directly targeting ID as a key treatment goal: Family Support Protocol for Adolescent Internalizing Disorders (Fam-AID). As an adjunctive protocol, Fam-AID will not require clinicians to markedly alter existing base practices for SUD. It will be anchored by three evidence-based foundations for treating co-occurring adolescent ID. First, it prioritizes family engagement in services and family-oriented treatment goals, which have been shown to enhance outcomes for youth SUD and ID alike. Second, it is a modular protocol that features core elements of manualized treatment for ID; core element interventions enhance treatment effectiveness by fostering implementation feasibility and sustainability in usual care. Third, it seeks to reinforce the family safety net to prevent teen self-harm. In accord with these foundations, and pending pilot development, we anticipate that Fam-AID will contain five treatment modules that can be delivered in any sequence to meet client needs: (1) Family Engagement of caregivers and primary supports in treatment planning and services; (2) Relational Reframing of family constraints, resiliencies, and social capital connected to the youth's ID symptoms; (3) Functional Analysis of the youth's ID symptoms and related behaviors; (4) Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) core techniques to address the youth's ID symptoms and functional needs, featuring three transdiagnostic interventions (emotion acceptance, emotional exposure, behavioral activation) to address negative affect and emotional dysregulation underlying both depression and anxiety; and (5) Family Psychoeducation and Safety Planning focused on education about comorbid SUD/ID and prevention of youth self-harm. All interventions featured in each module have strong empirical support.\n\nThe Fam-AID protocol will contain several innovations intended to boost treatment feasibility and impact for this vulnerable group. Aligned with the core elements strategy, it will be designed for uptake by all motivated clinicians regardless of their clinical orientation and training. It will use evidence-based family engagement techniques to systematically integrate caregivers in the treatment process; typically, families are not centralized in SUD services for youth despite compelling empirical and clinical rationale to do so. It will feature a treatment customization exercise in which clients and therapists collaboratively select CBT techniques to integrate in ongoing treatment based on functional ID assessment.\n\nTo achieve study aims we will first develop a Fam-AID implementation toolkit during a three-part Pilot Phase at one pilot site: (a) Solicit provider input on Fam-AID components; (b) Create video-based training and fidelity procedures, leveraging the PI's existing online therapist training and consultation resources in core CBT techniques for adolescent SUD, as well as the Co-I's equivalent training resources for adolescent ID; (c) Pilot the toolkit with 4-6 clients. In Years 2-3 we will conduct an Interrupted Time Series Study for N = 60 SUD/ID cases across two sites serving diverse youth: 30 will receive TAU, and then following line staff training, 30 new cases will receive TAU enhanced by adjunctive Fam-AID. Aim 1: Feasibility will examine Fam-AID cases for acceptability via client and therapist interviews and fidelity benchmarks via therapist- and observer-report of module coverage and protocol dose. Aim 2: Outcomes will test TAU vs. TAU + Fam-AID for immediate impact on family member attendance and ultimate impacts on adolescent ID symptoms at 3- and 6-month follow-up."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Internalizing Disorders", "Substance Use Disorders"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Family Support Protocol for Adolescent Internalizing Disorders (Fam-AID)", "description": "(1) Family Engagement of caregivers and primary supports in treatment planning and services; (2) Relational Reframing of family constraints, resiliencies, and social capital connected to the youth's ID symptoms; (3) Functional Analysis of the youth's ID symptoms and related behaviors; (4) Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) core techniques to address the youth's ID symptoms and functional needs, featuring three transdiagnostic interventions (emotion acceptance, emotional exposure, behavioral activation) to address negative affect and emotional dysregulation underlying both depression and anxiety; and (5) Family Psychoeducation and Safety Planning focused on education about comorbid SUD/ID and prevention of youth self-harm.

Anticoagulants work by making the blood thinner. They are thought to help reduce the risk of stroke and death caused by NVAF. In this study, researchers wanted to learn more about what elderly people think of taking anticoagulants that do not have any vitamin K in them. These are called non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs).\n\nThis study will include up to about 150 Belgian men and women aged 75 years and over who have NVAF and have been treated with NOACs. The study will also include about 10 doctors who have treated these patients.\n\nIn this study, there will be no required tests or visits. Instead, patients will answer a paper questionnaire about their use of NOACs. The researchers will ask the doctors questions about how they treat their patients using NOACs. The main types of questions the researchers will focus on are:\n\n* The patient characteristics of the elderly with NVAF who are treated with NOACs\n* The level of fear of the elderly about bleeding while using a blood thinner and the fear of stroke/thrombosis.\n* The geriatrician's thoughts about using NOACs to treat NVAF in elderly patients\n* Those patient characteristics geriatrician's find most important when deciding on the anticoagulation treatment in the elderly patients.\n\nThe information from this study will be collected between February and April 2021.

CMV transmission to the fetus occurs in about one third of women who are infected in first trimester. Babies infected before birth are at risk for serious neurological complications such as intellectual disability, seizures, deafness, and even death. Most couples facing a diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus infection in their unborn baby focus heavily on the predicted neurological outcome for their child. To date, methods to assess brain development in fetuses have been mainly limited to detecting structural brain abnormalities by ultrasound. However, these ultrasound signs may not become apparent until very late in pregnancy, and some neurological disability is not accompanied by any structural brain changes. More research on methods of predicting neurodevelopmental outcome independent of structural brain malformations before third trimester is urgently needed.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate a new method of studying the health of unborn babies using amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis is often performed after maternal CMV infection to diagnose fetal infection. Prior research by Dr Hui has demonstrated that cell free RNA in amniotic fluid can provide meaningful information from multiple organs including the fetal brain. The investigators propose to collect and analyse a small sample of amniotic fluid to detect which genes are turned \"on\" or \"off\" (gene expression) in a fetus that has a congenital CMV infection, compared to those without any infection.\n\nThe genes that are differentially expressed in CMV infected fetuses will then be analysed to provide information on the broad physiological processes that are altered due to the infection (\"functional analysis\") and identify neurodevelopmental gene transcripts of interest for future studies (\"biomarker discovery\")."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Cytomegalovirus Infections", "Neurologic Dysfunction"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "amniocentesis", "description": "mRNA sequencing on amniotic fluid samples of fetuses after maternal seroconversion for CMV", "armGroupLabels": ["mRNA sequencing"], "otherNames": ["mRNA sequencing"]}]}}}

However the data are contradicting in respect to the direction of this association and therefore the net effect of UPS activity on the cardiovascular system is not known. Inhibitors of UPS are currently standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Heart failure and hypertension have been reported in studies of carfilzomib, an irreversible 2nd generation proteasome inhibitor, both as a single agent and in combination with other drugs but their potential vascular toxicity is not adequately studied. Furthermore, as the role of the UPS has not been studied yet clinically but only in experimental and autopsy based studies, assessment of UPS inhibition in humans would facilitate understanding of the UPS-mediated pathophysiologic mechanisms in human atherosclerosis. Thus, this project may stimulate further research on the role of UPS in atherogenesis and potential new therapeutic approaches on vascular dysfunction may arise. We designed the following project in order to investigate the acute and chronic effect of Carfilzomib (CFZ) on cardiovascular function. Patients with an indication to receive CFZ will be recruited to be followed in the Clinical Therapeutics Department in pre-specified timepoints. Functional and structural measurements including markers of arterial stiffness and subclinical atherosclerosis will be performed using non-invasive well-validated techniques. Blood pressure will be also evaluated using 24h hour ambulatory monitoring. Evaluation of cardiac function will be performed at baseline and thereafter at 6 months or earlier if a suspicious event occurs necessitating evaluation of cardiac function. In parallel and at each time point, the activity of UPS and intracellular levels of ubiquitin conjugates will be measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and red blood cells (RBCs) using enzymatic proteasome activity assays and western blot techniques, respectively."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Multiple Myeloma"]}, "designModule": {}, "armsInterventionsModule": {}}}

The current diagnostic technique (standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies \\[TRUS-bx\\]) rely on multiple prostate biopsy cores (10-12 samples) and if negative repeated biopsy sessions. This increases both patient complications (severe infections, bleeding and anxiety) and the diagnosis of insignificant cancer causing overtreatment. Still, significant cancers are missed. In addition, worldwide antibiotic-resistant bacteria increase, while effective antibiotics are declining. Thus, a noninvasive diagnostic tool to improve selection of men with clinically suspicion of PCa who need a biopsy from those who can avoid one is strongly needed. Previous studies in our department show that MRI in a selected patient cohort with prior negative TRUS-bx can improve the detection rate of clinically significant PCa and allows for a more accurate assessment of cancer stage and aggressiveness. However, the value of an MRI used as a first-line tool in the diagnostic examination of men in suspicion of PCa is uncertain. Furthermore, a full scale MRI prostate examination recommended by the European Society of Urogenital Radiology includes intravenous contrast-media and multiple sequences. This is both time-consuming and cost full, which reduces its feasibility for more widespread clinical implementation. We believe that a simpler, faster biparametric MRI (bpMRI) using less scan sequences and circumvents intravenous contrast-media and anti-peristaltic drugs would decrease image acquisition time, reduce costs and is sufficient to preserve diagnostic accuracy for sPCa detection in biopsy-naive men. Consequently, we will include biopsy-naive men in a protocol-based research project. The objective is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of bpMRI to rule out sPCa and whether a bpMRI can be used as a diagnostic non-invasive screening tool to 1) improve the diagnosis of sPCa 2) assess cancer aggressiveness 3) increase precision of biopsies and 4) reduce the number of biopsy sessions and cores. We evaluate the clinical significance of the detected cancers and whether bpMRI could be used as a triage test to improve the diagnosis of sPCa and aid in the determination of which men could safely avoid unnecessary biopsies.\n\nThis new diagnostic approach has the potential to significantly reduce patient hazards and complications. We aim to reach 1000 included men. We believe that bpMRI used in the clinical decision-making has the potential to change the future management of PCa. However, we still miss the scientific evidence to substantiate its preliminary promising results before this technique can be widely used to benefit all men.

To look at blood flow in the brain, NIRS uses a low-power light source with detectors that see how the light changes as it passes through brain tissue. Brain blood flow can indicate which parts of the brain are active during different tasks. Researchers want to study children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and will use NIRS to compare the blood flow in the brain of children with ADHD and ASD with that of typically developing children.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To see how well NIRS can detect changes in brain blood flow during tests of thinking and memory in children.\n* To compare blood flow in the brains of typically developing children and those with ADHD or ASD.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Children between 4 and 8 years of age with ASD, ADHD, or children with no psychiatric diagnoses.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will be screened for eligibility. Those who are taking stimulant medication for ADHD or ASD will need to stop taking it for 3 days before the study visit.\n* After participating in a screening assessment, all participants will have one study visit. At this visit, they will have be asked to complete two tasks during a NIRS scan. For both tasks, they will react to images on a computer screen. This visit will last about 2 hours.\n* This is a testing study only.

In clinical trials involving kidney transplant recipients, markers of kidney function, such as serum creatinine, are increasingly being used as outcomes to evaluate new treatments. However, serum creatinine is not very accurate or sensitive at detecting change in kidney transplant function. Newer methods of evaluating kidney function, such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation and cystatin C, are known to be accurate markers of function in patients with non-transplant kidney disease. This study will compare the MDRD estimate and cystatin C estimate of kidney function with an accepted method (radioisotope clearance study) of measuring true kidney function in 250 renal transplant patients. Each patient will have 2 measurements made at least 3 months apart to determine the accuracy and responsiveness to change over time for the MDRD equation and cystatin C.

Nevertheless, in current post-stroke gait rehabilitation (research) the upper limbs are barely targeted. To address this gap, my project aims to investigate the selective motor control of the upper limbs during walking and the contribution of the cortical activity to the arm swing in independent walkers after stroke.\n\nTo gain insight in the direct effects of stroke on the arm swing, the primary motor control of the arm swing will be evaluated by determining muscle synergies (i.e group of muscles working together as a task-specific functional unit). Additionally, the cortical activity (EEG-analysis) during walking of persons post-stroke will be compared to healthy controls and the relationship between stroke-induced changes in cortical activity and arm swing deviations will be assessed. Furthermore, I will evaluate whether improvements in cortical activity relate to improvements in primary motor control of the arm swing.\n\nThis innovative project will be the first to investigate the direct coupling between the cortex and the muscle synergies in persons post-stroke during independent walking to investigate the arm swing. These fundamental insights in the primary motor control of the arm swing and the contribution of the cortical activity will allow to develop targeted interventions aiming to improve arm swing and as such optimize post-stroke gait rehabilitation.\n\nResearch questions:\n\n1. How can muscle synergies explain arm swing alterations in independent walkers after stroke?\n2.

Due to excessive proliferation, the blasts displace normal hematopoietic cells and bone marrow failure appears. Leukemic cells also infiltrate extramedullary tissues.\n\nFollowing the standard chemotherapy treatment, the CR rate achieved is around 65-75% for all patients and 15% lower when considering only patients over 65 years. Modifications to the standard regimen consist of replacing the DNR for a cytotoxic one, modifying the dose of ara-C or adding a third drug.\n\nGemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg \u00ae) is an immunoconjugate between anti-CD33 antibody and a cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic, calicheamicin. Mylotarg \u00ae antibody specifically binds to CD33, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein expressed in over 90% of LMA10. Mylotarg \u00ae selectively transports the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin into leukemic cells and hematopoietic progenitors differentiated from the myelomonocytic line, while respecting the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. Calicheamicin is released only after the fixation of the antibody anti-CD33 and its internalization by the cell, after which binds to and damages the DNA.\n\nMylotarg \u00ae is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of CD33 positive AML in first relapse, for patients older than 60 years non-candidates for other intensive treatment modalities.\n\nSince the efficacy of Mylotarg \u00ae is equivalent and its toxicity profile less than the conventional therapy, it is logical to conduct a phase II trial exploring the role of Mylotarg \u00ae in the early stages of treatment of AML.\n\nPrevious experience with gemtuzumab ozogamicin in relapsed patients led to its use combined with induction chemotherapy. The aim was to improve the CR rate reached with the latter and reduce relapse after achieving greater leukemic cytoreduction.\n\nRecent data from the HOVON group support that the administration of G-CSF before and during induction chemotherapy decreases the incidence of relapse in patients with AML, particularly those considered to have intermediate risk.\n\nEverything mentioned above justifies to investigate the combination of GO combined with chemotherapy with IDR and ara-C in standard 3x7 scheme and analyze the effect of sensitization with G-CSF in patients with AML de novo.

It influences about 2,700 women with about 1,000 women dying of cervical cancer each year and in Taiwan. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have been consistently implicated in causing cervical cancer especially those high-risk types which have been strongly associated with cervical cancer. In recent years, there has been compelling evidence that infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major etiologic factor in the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinoma.\n\nAs in most virus-induced diseases, an adequate immune response is likely to play a key role in the clearance of HPV infections and HPV-related lesions. This assumption is born out by both epidemiological studies and animal models. Immune-compromised patients such as HIV-infected women, organ transplant recipients, and patients suffering from other forms of malignancies, are at a higher risk of developing CIN lesions and invasive cervical cancer. Moreover, several studies establish the existence of natural HPV E7-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity in humans. Only a minority of women infected with oncogenic HPV types develop CIN or cervical cancer. Indeed, the majority of CIN lesions do not progress or even regress to normal cytology, indicating that other factors such as an inadequate immune function are necessary for the development of progressive CIN lesions and cervical carcinoma.\n\nConsequently, the HLA class I and II phenotypes may be correlated with an effective immune response against HPV-associated cervical lesions. Differences in the recognition of foreign antigens, such as those contributed by alleles at the HLA class I or II loci, might be proposed to affect the risk of developing cervical cancer.\n\nIn the present proposal, the investigators would like to examine the HLA class I and II associations among Taiwanese women with cervical neoplasia. The purposes of this proposal are:\n\n1. to address the relationships between the HLA class I and II haplotype, HPV infection, and cervical cancer; and\n2. to elucidate the immunologic responses to HPV type 16 in different HLA class I and II haplotypes. It will help the investigators to identify which population of HLA genotypes is more susceptible to HPV infection and progresses to invasive cervical cancer. The results of this research will be very useful for the prevention and screening of cervical cancer in the future."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Cancer of Cervix"]}, "designModule": {}}}

Secondly, the group BA treatment delivered to patients in 2017 will be enhanced with two treatment augmentations. One augmentation will target stasis outcomes through the addition of specific 'if-then' planning (known as implementation intentions) when setting between-session homework and the other augmentation will target patient drop-out by informing patients about group BA effectiveness and therapy-dose evidence. The stasis outcomes and drop-out rates from the enhanced treatment in the trial will be compared with the archived outcomes to see if the intervention has had an effect and the role of engaging in valued living as a mechanism of change for depression symptoms will be examined. It is hypothesised that a) 50% of patients who have received the existing BA group treatment for depression will have a stasis outcome, b) there will be a significant reduction in depression stasis outcomes and drop-out rate following the enhanced BA group treatment delivered in the trial and c) engagement in valued living will have a mediating effect on outcome for responding patients following the enhanced BA group treatment but the effect will not be present for patients with a stasis outcome."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Depression"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Behavioural Activation Group (BAG) Psychotherapy", "description": "Behavioural activation (BA) is a psychotherapy intervention based on behaviour theory and operant conditioning.

Stroke represents the leading cause of long-term disability. The specificity of stroke is the sequelae polymorphism that can occurs: physical disability, cognitive deficit and sensitive trouble. Then this large extend of sequelae may have a different impact on daily life. Therefore, we have to consider the individual's own resources and in his whole environment to face the situation. We suppose that each situation, each post-stroke disability will have a different social impact in stroke survivors and their caregivers. Nowadays, Barthel Index and Rankin scale are the standards for the assessment of the stroke impact on survivors' daily life. However, what is the real impact of an activity limitation in daily life? How consider the psychosocial impact of stroke only with functional indicators? For this study we will consider handicap and disability in a societal way. In fact, the WHO developed in 2001 the International Classification of functioning, disability and health that allows to bring the concept of participation restriction, this is to say the consequences of a disability in the real life. The ICF allows to bring a conceptual framework of participation restriction.\n\nPsychosocial consequences of stroke are relatively unknown especially in France. According to our hypothesis, patients with major disabilities and their caregivers will experience more psychosocial consequences and participation restriction in terms of emotional health, quality of life and burden. Also, we hypothesize that stroke severity, the typology of disabilities (motor, cognitive and sensorial) will have a different impact on patients and proxys' lifes in terms of psychosocial consequences, participation restriction and quality of life.\n\nTYBRA study is a prospective multicentric cohort study that mixes qualitative and quantitative approaches. The first aim of the quantitative approach is to explore factors related to patients and their caregivers at 6 months that predict participation restriction at 12 months post-stroke. The first aim of the qualitative study is to explore the experience of stroke in minor stroke patients and their proxys."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Stroke Patients and Their Caregivers"]}, "designModule": {}}}

This is the likely treatment participants will be having if they decide not to take part in this study. Increasing the dose to 60Gy is shown to increase the chance that rectal cancer will be treated completely, a term known as \"complete pathological response\". Patients who have a complete pathological response after their treatment can avoid surgery and enter into a surveillance programme to monitor for early signs of the cancer returning. Surveillance can mean 3-6 months camera tests and MRI scans depending on the local unit. If these patients continue to show signs of complete pathological response then they can avoid long term complications from surgery such as a stoma. Unit studies have shown that that increasing the dose of radiotherapy can cause slightly more bowel and bladder side effects, but using adaptive radiotherapy to limit radiotherapy to normal tissue could keep the rate of bothersome side effects as low, which is similar as standard treatment.\n\nAll adaptive treatments within this trial will be delivered on a state of the art, radiotherapy machine called an MR-linac (Magnetic Resonance Linear Accelerator). It combines an MRI scanner with a radiotherapy treatment machine called a Linear Accelerator (called a 'linac' for short). The use of the MR-linac means there is no extra radiation dose given when taking daily images to check for the position of participants rectal cancer (unlike CT scans or X-ray). It also enables the investigators to adapt or 'tweak' the radiotherapy plan each day to match the exact position of the rectal cancer and adjacent organs. The non-adaptive fractions can be delivered on either the MR-Linac or CT-linac depending on factors such as treatment machine availability.\n\nThe investigators will deliver the treatment on the MR-linac using a technique called intensity modulated radiotherapy (precise X-ray treatment, called IMRT for short). IMRT is able to mould radiotherapy treatment according to what the investigators can see, therefore enabling the investigators to give highly targeted treatment. The investigators already have considerable experience in delivering radiotherapy to rectal cancer with this machine and now wish to focus on whether they could increase dose to benefit long term outcome for all rectal cancer patients as well as reducing the side effects of treatment.\n\nThe purpose of this research is to increase the dose to rectal cancer while adapting to the changes that the investigators can see to the rectal cancer during treatment. This means that if the rectal cancer is seen to reduce in size they will be able to deliver a 'shrinking boost' according to what can be seen. This will enable the investigators to give high dose radiotherapy to the cancer whilst limiting radiotherapy to healthy tissue. Without the ability to adapt to changes that the investigators see to the tumour throughout the entire treatment course, standard treatment delivers dose to a larger area of surrounding healthy tissue to ensure that the tumour is sufficiently targeted.\n\nThe investigators want to find out if by using this adaptive, shrinking boost approach, they can safely increase radiotherapy dose to rectal cancer, whilst limiting the side effects you experience, in comparison with standard treatment. If this is possible, then this would lead into further clinical trial where the investigators would compare outcomes of higher-dose treatment to standard-of-care. The investigators can't be certain that the side effects will be different, and they don't know if this treatment results in the best chance of cancer cure. However they know from other studies that this is the likely outcome, with surgery being delayed for patients. Patients who have a complete pathological response after combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment enter into a surveillance programme where MRI and camera tests (flexible sigmoidoscopy) are performed at regular intervals looking for early signs of cancer returning.\n\nThe investigators expect that the chance of participants having a complete pathological response with this technique is higher than with standard dose, although the investigators can't know this for sure until they have completed further studies.

It manifests clinically as acute onset, severe neurocognitive impairment, and periodic fluctuating progression, and is one of the most common complications after major cardiac and vascular surgery. It typically occurs within one week after surgery, with a peak incidence at 24 hours postoperatively. Due to differences in the basic characteristics of study populations and assessment tools, the reported incidence of postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery varies significantly, ranging from 14% to 50%. Postoperative delirium not only prolongs patients' ICU and hospital stays, increases medical costs, and raises short-term and long-term mortality rates, but is also closely associated with long-term cognitive impairment, dementia, and a decline in activities of daily living. The pathophysiology of delirium is complex and may be caused by a combination of multiple factors, including microembolism, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and systemic inflammatory response. Since the mechanisms underlying delirium are not yet fully understood, effective treatments are currently lacking. Postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery is a significant clinical challenge for medical teams.\n\nThe brain is distinct from other organs, as the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier isolate the exchange between the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and extracellular fluid. For a long time, it was believed that the brain lacks a lymphatic system, and the extracellular fluid in brain tissue was considered stagnant. The lack of fluid flow can lead to the accumulation of protein waste, which is very detrimental to brain health. The glymphatic system is a major update in the anatomical knowledge of the central nervous system in recent years. It is a highly organized fluid transport system within the human brain, with the primary function of promoting convective exchange between the interstitial fluid of the central nervous system and cerebrospinal fluid. The main physiological function of the glymphatic system is to clear metabolic waste and large-molecule solutes, thereby maintaining central homeostasis; it also acts as a communicator between the brain and peripheral immunity, ensuring that the central nervous system is not overlooked by the immune system. Additionally, the glymphatic system helps deliver nutrients to the brain, such as glucose, lactate, and amino acids. Dysfunction of the glymphatic system is associated with various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and related research has become a frontier and hotspot in the field of neuroscience.\n\nDysfunction of the glymphatic system leads to the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid and tau proteins in the brain, which cannot be cleared, and is one of the pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease. There is a strong bidirectional association between Alzheimer's disease and delirium. Patients with Alzheimer's disease-related dementia are 2.5 to 4.7 times more likely to experience delirium, and the incidence of newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease-related dementia in patients with delirium increases by 12.5 times. However, the underlying mechanisms of postoperative delirium remain unclear, which has motivated our investigation into the causal relationship between the glymphatic system and postoperative delirium. From a theoretical perspective, chronic dysfunction of the glymphatic system signifies brain vulnerability and a higher incidence of neurological diseases. If subjected to surgical stress, sudden dysfunction may represent acute glymphatic system insufficiency. With the rapid development of clinical imaging tools, functional MRI is a non-invasive method for assessing glymphatic system function, bringing possibilities to clinical research.\n\nTherefore, this study aims to explore the association between postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery and the glymphatic system, in order to deepen the understanding of glymphatic system function and investigate the mechanisms of postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery, and to provide ideas for new interventions for postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Postoperative Delirium (POD)"]}, "designModule": {}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Blood was drawn for proteomics testing and Magnetic Resonance Imaging.", "description": "The function of the glymphatic system was assessed by MRI before the surgery.

GD is characterized by progressive and persistent brain circuits alterations (reward, stress, memory, impulse control and cognitive functions), so a possible treatment could be based on neuromodulation of specific brain areas. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation, which provides magnetic stimuli on certain brain areas parts with short and long-term effects. rTMS has the FDA approval for some neurological (headache) and psychiatric (treatment-resistant depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder) disease. Nowadays several evidence in scientific literature lead to a promise use of rTMS also in addiction field with a possible indication also for GD.\n\nObjectives: the main outcome is to assess symptoms related to GD (craving, play frequencies, money lost) before and after rTMS stimulation on left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).\n\nEligibility: Healthy, right-handed adults ages 18-65 with a diagnosis of GD.

The addition of DLE to the symptomatic treatment could decrease the severity of the clinical outcome (signs and symptoms) in individuals with an acute respiratory infection (cases suspected/confirmed by COVID-19).\n2. The addition of DLE to the symptomatic treatment could decrease the clinical deterioration due to the acute respiratory infectious process (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).\n3. The addition of DLE to the symptomatic treatment could decrease the duration of the clinical outcome (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2 Infection"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["PHASE2"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Dialyzable Leukocyte Extract", "description": "Experimental Intervention.

Low PA levels are associated with poor health (e.g. diabetes, high blood pressure) and early mortality. Girls are less likely than boys to be active, and their rates of participation drop off more steeply during adolescence. Girls report many barriers to exercise, including transportation issues and feeling self-conscious about their appearance and abilities. School-based PA programs that try to improve health, mainly through aerobic exercise and education, have had a small effect to date. However, the few programs that included resistance training as the focus showed strong improvements in health related measures. In this project, we will examine the effect of a female strength and conditioning specialist on decreasing barriers and increasing the overall health of high school girls, with the delivery of in-school, girls-only resistance training programs. We will see if physical and mental health changes with the training, and how the presence of the S \\& C specialist affects the girls' social interactions within the school.

Then they will be put under general anesthesia. They will have an endoscopy. A lighted tube will be inserted into the mouth and go down to the stomach. First, the standard device will be used. Then participants will be injected with fluorescein. This is a contrast agent. Then the microscope will be added to the tube and the endoscopic evaluation of the stomach will be repeated. During the procedure, biopsies will be taken from different areas of the stomach. Participants will be observed for a few hours after the procedure.\n\nAbout 14 days after the endoscopy, participants will be asked to return to the clinic for a follow-up visit. This visit can also be conducted over the phone."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Gastric Cancer", "Gastric Neoplasms"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["PHASE2"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Endoscope+Cellvizio(R) 100 microscope", "description": "Patients will undergo white-light, upper endoscopy.

In macular edema, blood vessels in the retina, a thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye become leaky and the retina swells. The macula, the center part of the retina that is responsible for fine vision may also swell, causing vision loss. Traditional laser treatment (argon blue or green or yellow) for macular swelling, or edema, causes scarring that can expand and possibly lead to more loss of vision. Studies with a different type of laser (diode) may be less damaging. The results of this study on side effects of the treatments will be used to design a larger study of effectiveness. This study will also examine whether celecoxib (Celebrex\u00ae (Registered Trademark)), an anti-arthritis drug that reduces inflammation and swelling, can reduce inflammation and swelling of the retina. Patients with elevated cholesterol levels will be invited to participate in a cholesterol reduction part of the study to compare normal-pace cholesterol reduction with accelerated reduction.\n\nPatients 18 years of age and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and macular edema that requires laser treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with the following tests and procedures:\n\n* Medical history: to review past medical conditions and treatments.\n* Physical examination: to measure vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature, breathing rate) and examine the head and neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, arms and legs.\n* Eye examination: to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and examine pupils, lens, retina, and eye movements. The pupils will be dilated with drops for this examination.\n* Blood tests: to measure cholesterol, blood clotting time, hemoglobin A1C (a measure of diabetes control), and to evaluate liver and kidney function.\n* Eye photography: to help evaluate the status of the retina and changes that may occur in the future. Special photographs of the inside of the eye are taken using a camera that flashes a bright light into the eye. From 2 to 20 pictures may be taken, depending on the eye condition.\n* Fluorescein angiography: to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel abnormality.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to take celecoxib or placebo (an inactive, look-alike pill). Participants who have elevated cholesterol levels may return for a brief visit after 1 month. All patients will return for follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients who require laser treatment will be randomly assigned to one of the two laser treatments. For these procedures, eye drops are put in the eye to numb the surface and a contact lens is placed on the eye during the laser beam application. Several visits may be required for additional laser treatments. The maximum number of treatments depends on how well the treatment is working. Patients who respond well to the study medication may receive no laser treatments. After the first year, patients will be followed every 6 months until either the patient returns for a 3-year visit, the last enrolled patient returns for the 1-year visit, or the patient requests to leave the study.

In 2021, the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the Belgian Red Cross-Flanders issued new guidelines which included the description of a modified recovery position to avoid problems in victims with joint stiffness and to overcome potential obstructed venous return in the dependent arm. Based on good practice insights, the dependent arm will now be extended and not bent to support the other arm. However, there is currently no evidence available to support a specific recovery position.\n\nObjectives: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of different recovery positions on perfusion of the forearm and associated comfort.\n\nMethods: In this cross-over randomized controlled trial, 24 healthy volunteers will be placed in either the lateral recovery position with extended dependent arm or with bent arm, and in the other position thereafter. Before and between both recovery positions, the volunteers will be positioned supine for 15 min. Several perfusion indices of the forearm will be non-or mildly invasively monitored in the respective recovery positions by radial artery tonometry, ulnar artery echo doppler and venous congestion plethysmography. Subjective participant's discomfort and pain will be assessed as well. Differences in continuous outcomes between the different recovery positions will be assessed with paired t-tests or wilcoxon signed-rank test.\n\nDiscussion: The benefit of lateral positioning of adults and children with decreased level of consciousness has been widely accepted despite limited supportive scientific evidence. We here will provide direct evidence (i) whether venous drainage in the dependent limb is impaired when positioning the victim in the lateral recovery position with bent arms and (ii) whether this potential complication can be minimized by extending the dependent arm.

An alarming one-third of KT patients experience MNA even though the problem is preventable. Adherence intervention studies have proven marginally effective for those with acute and chronic illnesses and ineffective for adult KT recipients. Using a randomized controlled trial design with an attention-control group, this R01 will test an innovative 6-month SystemCHANGE intervention to enhance immunosuppressive MA in adult non-adherent KT recipients. This intervention shows great promise for increasing MA with a large effect size of 1.4 in our pilot study. Grounded in the socio-ecological model, SystemCHANGE seeks to systematically improve MA behaviors by identifying and shaping routines, involving supportive others in routines, and using medication taking feedback through small patient-lead experiments to change and maintain behavior. The Medication Event Monitoring System cap, which contains microelectronics that record the date and time of the cap removal, will be used to measure MA.

The majority of syndromes involve an obstructive mechanism (OSA), caused by a reduction in the caliber of the upper airway (UA), most often associated with hypotonia of the surrounding muscles, preventing air from entering the UA during inspiration. The clinical consequences of this syndrome are excessive fatigue and daytime sleepiness, which have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients.\n\nDespite the positive results on apnea-hypopnea index and daytime sleepiness of continuous positive airway pressure (today's reference treatment), its 3-year compliance rate (i.e 59.9% according to a study by Abdelghani et al points to the need to develop other associated therapies.\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the efficacy of physiotherapy, such as physical activity and oro-pharyngeal muscle strengthening, notably on the apnea-hypopnea index and daytime sleepiness measured by the Epworth scale.\n\nFew studies have investigated the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT), even though the use of the inspiratory musculature (i.e. the diaphragm) is a means of supplementing the peri-pharyngeal muscles, as it helps to maintain the permeability of the upper airways. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) could therefore be considered as part of the physiotherapeutic management of the OSA. The heterogeneity of current results concerning IMT in OSA , but above all the lack of evidence that it is dangerous, means that new clinical studies could be carried out in an attempt to demonstrate its efficacy.

Patients who are obese (defined as body mass index greater than 35) tend to be even more susceptible to this effect of Propofol.

CVD risk factors can be modifiable (nutrition, physical activity, obesity, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes) and non-modifiable (age, gender, ethnicity, family history and socioeconomic status). Chronic exposure to CVD risk factors induces oxidative stress and promotes inflammation. In addition, endothelial cells in response to the inflammatory reaction secrete growth factors, leading to the destruction of vascular endothelium and promoting atherogenesis.\n\nOxidative stress refers to the imbalance between anti-oxidant and pro-oxidant compounds, with predominance of the pro-oxidant ones. Reactive Oxygen Species overproduction has been implicated in pathogenesis and complications of numerous diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and chronic kidney disease.\n\nMoreover, endothelium consists of a single layer of endothelial cells; it is the natural barrier between blood and tissues and also an endocrine organ. It plays a key role in vascular homeostasis by maintaining a balance between vasodilation and vasoconstriction and is responsible for fluid filtration, blood vessel tone, hormone trafficking, hemostasis, regulation of blood flow and growth of blood vessels. Thus, reductions in endothelial function are detrimental and predict and precede the development of overt CVD.\n\nSesame belongs to Pedaliaceae family and can be consumed in different forms such as seeds, oil or tahini, i.e., a 100 % peeled, ground and roasted sesame paste. Tahini is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, proteins, vitamin E and lignans, such as sesamin, sesamolin and sesamol. Recent studies have indicated that tahini consumption can lower blood pressure and pulse rate and improve endothelial function and glycemic response in healthy males postprandially.\n\nHowever, only two studies are available in the current literature concerning the effect on diabetes, one of them in patients with type 2 diabetes and one in diabetic animal model.

Their etiology can vary widely (spontaneous, iatrogenic, post-surgical perforation, anastomotic dehiscence, inflammatory process) and their treatment is complex, sometimes unresolved, and often requires a multidisciplinary approach. The chronicity of digestive and pelvic organ fistulas (e.g., vagino-vesical fistulas) is related to tissue repair mechanisms, which are delayed and subverted in favor of fibrotic and inflammatory processes. In these cases, the wound healing cascade stops at the inflammatory phase and does not result in the proliferation phase. The transition depends on changing levels of cytokines and growth factors. In the persistence of the inflammatory phase, polymorphonucleates and macrophages are active, phagocytosing and releasing enzymes that also damage healthy tissue. In this context, the anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, antiapoptotic, and tissue regenerative effects of adipose tissue-derived stromal or stem cells (ADSCs) could play a decisive role. In fact, ADSCs exhibit immunosuppressive properties on the proliferation of T cells, B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells and modulate inflammation by implanting a regenerative niche with appropriate paracrine communication and subsequent tissue regeneration. \"Fat grafting\" has a wide range of application: it started with plastic surgery and regenerative medicine, then in orthopedics, maxillofacial surgery, and vascular surgery. Since 2019, a new procedure using processed fat grafting for the treatment of chronic fistulas of the gastrointestinal tract and pelvic organs has been initiated at the Agostino Gemelli IRCCS University Polyclinic Foundation and has become \"standard of care,\" with good results. The procedure is quick, safe, minimally invasive and cost-effective. Subcutaneous fat, immediately after harvesting from the same patient, is mechanically stimulated with oscillatory movements, then injected under endoscopic vision directly onto the orifice of the fistula. When the fat is centrifuged, it stimulates the activation of various mesenchymal stemness-related genes, such as Sox2, Nanog and Oct4. The increase in mRNAs is tens to hundreds of times and is accompanied by a pronounced increase in the expression of the anti-inflammatory protein TSG6 and suppression of TNFalpha, normally expressed by adipose tissue.\n\nThe objective of the study is to treat chronic fistula of the gastrointestinal tract and pelvic organs of any type, symptomatic and/or impacting quality of life, in whom all other treatments (medical, endoscopic, or surgical) have failed or are not candidates.\n\nOur primary endpoint is to evaluate the efficacy of the injection of autologous activated adipose tissue injection in these cases. Secondary endpoints evaluate the changes in patients' quality of life and the long-term efficacy of the activated fat injection."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Fistula Repair"]}, "designModule": {}, "armsInterventionsModule": {}}}

The objectives of this study are to: 1) determine if the use of the DA and SDM training program: a) increase clinicians' engagement of patients in decision making regarding their goals of care; b) increase adoption of evidence-based behaviours regarding goals-of-care decision making; and 2) identify patients' most frequent incomprehension, concerns, questions and clinicians' opportunities to improve the skills in goals-of-care decision making.\n\nMethods: This study will have three phases. Phase I (May-June 2017) will be a baseline evaluation of the current goals-of-care decision making process with elderly patients in a single ICU setting (Levis, Quebec). Phase II (July-August 2017) will be an evaluation of the goals-of-care decision making process in the same ICU using a DA.

The study will then evaluate the goals-of-care decision making process after completion of the training program and using the DA. The investigators will observe and audio- or video-record all eligible elderly-intensivist dyads discussing goals of care during each phase. Two investigators will analyse the recordings using the OPTION 12 scale (measuring the extent that clinicians engage patients in SDM) and the ACCEPT quality indicators (measuring the extent to which intensivists engage in best practice goals-of-care discussions).

To mitigate the increase in dementia, it is crucial to prevent cognitive decline in at risk groups, such as older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Recent research has demonstrated that combining physical (PA) and cognitive activities yields positive effects on the cognitive health of older adults. However, it is essential to explore effective ways of implementing this approach for MCI patients as it may help prevent dementia. An intergenerational program offers a novel and innovative method to achieve this goal by involving both older and younger generations in a single (exercise) program aimed at promoting the health behavior of both groups. Engaging children in an intergenerational, cognitively enriched exercise program for MCI patients primarily benefits the older adults while also providing advantages for the adult children. Therefore, this intergenerational project serves as a valuable and motivating force to enhance the physical, cognitive, and psychosocial health of MCI patients, with a secondary aim of positively impacting the adult children.\n\nPhase 1 of this project (=current study) involves developing the intergenerational, cognitively enriched exercise program. This will be accomplished using a theoretical framework in combination with a co-creation approach, which actively involves MCI patients in the intervention development. Ten thinkaloud interviews (lasting approximately 2 hours) will be conducted with MCI patients and one of their adult children. The insights gained from these interviews will be used to adapt an existing exercise intervention for MCI patients according to their specific needs. Prior to the interview, participants will also be asked to complete a short questionnaire that collects basic demographic information."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Mild Cognitive Impairment"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "No intervention, interviews with MCI patients as part of the development phase", "description": "No intervention, interviews with MCI patients as part of the development phase", "armGroupLabels": ["Interview"]}]}}}

There are no published local data on the efficacy of Urokinase, though this is widely used in local practice as first line in the management of TDC dysfunction. Previous studies have also varied in terms of study methodology, dose and administration of urokinase in the form of systemic infusion or catheter lock therapy, with varying success rates of 78-97% (2,4-8). Overall, majority of these studies utilized higher doses of urokinase - some studies reported higher patency rates with high dose systemic infusion (4,5) or higher success rates when a higher dose was compared to a lower dose of urokinase lock (6-8). Bleeding events were very rare even in studies that use much higher doses or systemic infusion of urokinase (2,4-8). Our own preliminary data show lower lower success rates of around 52.5% compared to published reports, the question remains on how we can improve our patency rate and cost-effectiveness in treating TDC dysfunction without an increase in risk of adverse events.

Biceps tenodesis is one of the most common surgeries for patients who have biceps tendon inflammation and/or instability, rotator cuff tears, and labral tears that do not get better with medications or physical therapy. A biceps tenodesis involves cutting the biceps tendon and reconnecting it to the shoulder with sutures or metal screws. After surgery, most patients are required to wear a shoulder sling and limit certain arm motions to protect the healing tendon. A recent study found using a more flexible rehabilitation protocol for biceps tenodesis did not change outcomes (strength or range-of-motion) and allows patients to return to some regular activities earlier. This data suggests patients may not need to wear a sling after surgery. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate this.\n\nThis study will have two groups-one that continues to wear the sling, and one that does not. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of these groups. At each follow-up visit after surgery, shoulder strength and range-of-motion will be measured and several surveys about shoulder function will be completed. These surveys will provide information to compare between both groups. If assigned to the group that wears the sling, patients will record how often they are wearing the sling in a paper diary/log. Additionally, at the 6-month follow-up, an ultrasound will be obtained to make sure the tendon is healing properly regardless of which group patients are assigned to.

The aim of investigators study is to develop/adopt an effective intervention specifically for elderly (65+) people with post COVID-19 condition, experiencing balance disorder and muscle weakness, in order to help them return to pre-infection mobility and function. This will be a randomized controlled study with pre- and post-intervention assessment. The participants will be recruited from nursing homes, retirement facilities, Universities of the Third Age, primary health care units (POZs), in keeping with the inclusion criteria.

However, neurological complications related to the surgery, such as ischemic injury, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and postoperative delirium, remain the main causes of increased postoperative mortality. Currently, there are limited measures for neuroprotection during the perioperative period of TAVR, and controversy continues over the effectiveness of intraoperative cerebral device placement. Consequently, strategies for neuroprotection during TAVR require active exploration. Previous studies have shown that statins have pleiotropic effects. In addition to inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, it also exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, stress-reducing, and platelet aggregation-inhibiting properties, as well as potential neuroprotective effects. The efficacy and safety of intensive statin therapy during the perioperative period of percutaneous coronary intervention have been extensively examined, and its role in improving long-term prognosis has been recognised. Since coronary heart disease and aortic valve stenosis share similar pathophysiological mechanisms, the use of statins in valve replacement surgery has also demonstrated positive effects. Research indicates that preoperative high-intensity statin therapy can reduce the incidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack following valve replacement surgery. Additionally, evidence suggests that preoperative statin use can decrease the occurrence of postoperative delirium. However, no evidence exists on whether perioperative intensive statin therapy during TAVR can reduce cerebral ischaemic injury and provide neuroprotection. This study aims to conduct a prospective, randomised, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of statin-enhanced therapy during the perioperative period of TAVR and to investigate whether it can reduce cerebral ischaemic injury after TAVR."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Aortic Stenosis", "Cerebral Ischaemic Injury"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["PHASE4"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Intensive statin treatment", "description": "Intensive statin group:\n\nAtorvastatin 80mg, orally administered 12 hours before surgery Atorvastatin 80mg, orally administered 2 hours before surgery", "armGroupLabels": ["Intensive Statin Group"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo Control", "description": "Placebo, tablets, oral administration 12 hours before surgery Placebo, tablet, oral administration 2 hours before surgery", "armGroupLabels": ["Controll Group"]}]}}}

This is expected to induce autophagy, which may mediate some of the biological effects of TXA on cells.

Among these lymphomas, follicular lymphomas (FLs), marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) emerge as the most prevalent entities. While FL and MZL are representative of indolent B-cell lymphomas, characterized by a slow progression of the disease and favorable clinical outcomes, DLBCL stands out as an aggressive lymphoma, often occuring from the transformation of a pre-existing indolent lymphoma.\n\nChromosome translocations are a hallmark of some NHL subtypes, offering insights into their molecular pathogenesis. For instance, the conventional FL is genetically characterized by the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, found in 85-90% of cases, resulting in sustained elevation of the antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2). However, certain FL cases lack BCL2 translocations and exhibit distinct clinical, morphological and phenotypical features with genetic heterogeneity.\n\nA subset of BCL2-negative FLs displays rearrangements within chromosomal region 3q27, inducing abnormal modulation of B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) expression. The BCL6 gene plays a critical role in germinal center development and B-cell differentiation. Previous investigations indicate that BCL6 rearrangements (BCL6-R) manifest distinct pathological and genetic features, diverging from classical FL presentations.\n\nFLs carrying BCL6-R commonly share a specific CD10- Bcl-2- Bcl-6+ phenotype, often accompanied by a monocytoid component and increased frequency of diffuse architectural patterns. Patients with BCL6-R tend to exhibit advanced clinical stages and complex genetic profiles.\n\nMZLs present differential diagnostic challenges due to shared monocytoid components, phenotypes traits, and common genetic features. The similarities observed between BCL6-R FL and MZL suggest a convergence in both morphological and genetic aspects, leading to intricate differentiation. Traditionally, these indolent NHLs with BCL6-R were categorized as FL and incorporated into the FL category in the WHO classification. However, few studies highlight the occurrence of BCL6-R in MZLs. This observation gives rise to the hypothesis that indolent NHLs exhibiting BCL6-R might correspond to a continuum comprising both FL and MZL.\n\nAdditionally, BCL6-R has been frequently documented in DLBCL cases with residual MZL component. These DLBCL cases might display a mutational profile reminiscent of MZL. This suggests a plausible origin of BCL6-R DLBCL from indolent BCL6-R MZLs or BCL6-R FLs cases."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Non Hodgkin Lymphoma", "Follicular Lymphoma", "Marginal Zone Lymphoma", "Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma"]}, "designModule": {}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Histopathological analysis", "description": "Morphological analysis will include the description of architectural patterns and cytological features on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples retrieved from the routine diagnostic archives of the Pathology Department of the University Hospital Lyon Sud.\n\nA panel of immunohistochemical staining will be analyzed including CD20, CD3, CD10, Bcl-6, Bcl-2, CD5, CD23, CD38, MUM1, Ig kappa, Ig lambda, MEF2B, LMO2, MNDA, IRTA1, P53, CMYC and Ki67 . /MIB1.

Traditionally, opioids have played an important role in treating postoperative pain. It is well established that opioids are highly effective in relieving pain; however opioids are associated with numerous side effects that include nausea, vomiting, constipation, ileus, bladder dysfunction, respiratory depression, pruritus, drowsiness, sedation, and allergic reaction. These opioid side effects, which range in severity, can significantly interfere with discharge home following colorectal surgery. Significant interest exists in the use of local anesthetic based regional anesthesia techniques as a means to extend the analgesic window for patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Specifically, the use of the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block as an adjunct in postoperative pain control has been widely reported in the anesthesia and colorectal surgery literature. Historically, the block was performed in a blind fashion with relative success and presently the block is typically performed either with ultrasound guidance or laparoscopic visualization. While TAP block has shown to be effective in post-operative pain control, the techniques used to place the block have not formally been compared.\n\nThe investigators are purposing a prospective, patient-blinded, randomized study of patients undergoing major colorectal surgery to compare TAP block under ultrasound guidance versus laparoscopic visualization versus no TAP block. The investigators hypothesize that laparoscopic-guided TAP block is non-inferior to ultrasound-guided TAP block with respect to perioperative pain control and either technique is superior to no TAP. In addition the investigators will measure procedural time, any adverse events related to the block, overall postoperative analgesic requirement, analgesic duration, postoperative pain scores, length of postoperative hospital stay, incidence of postoperative ileus, and overall patient satisfaction between the three groups."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Crohn's Disease", "Inflammatory Bowel Disease", "Postoperative Pain"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Placebo", "description": "The usual intraoperative and postoperative pain control; NO TAP block performed", "armGroupLabels": ["PLACEBO"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "US TAP Bupivacaine/Epinephrine", "description": "Ultrasound guided bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 1:400k will be injected to the transversus abdominis plane.", "armGroupLabels": ["US TAP Bupivacaine/Epinephrine"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Lap TAP Bupivacaine/Epinephrine", "description": "Laparoscopic guided bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 1:400k will be injected to the transversus abdominis plane.", "armGroupLabels": ["Lap TAP Bupivacaine/Epinephrine"]}]}}}

One area that holds great promise for the development of novel, effective therapies is noninvasive brain stimulation. The investigators have used one form of brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), for some time to modulate and enhance cognitive function in the brain, especially working memory (WM) function, which has a central role in most executive processing that occurs in the brain. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a paradigm of TMS which has been shown to effectively modulate WM. Moreover, TBS can modulate gamma neural oscillations in the brain and neural activity, both of which have been implicated in the physiology of WM and pathophysiology of the disease process in schizophrenia, making these measures highly valuable for assessing physiological effects of TBS on cognition, quality of life and cortical inhibition. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of TBS on WM in patients with schizophrenia, to develop evidence for potential brain stimulation techniques to treat cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.\n\nStudy activities and population group: Study subjects will be inpatient schizophrenic individuals with minimal positive symptoms and predominant cognitive deficits at Duke University Hospital. In an initial session they will be screened and taught a WM task. Following this, one TBS session will follow in which TBS will target dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. They will perform the WM task before, with and after the TBS, with an expected pre-post enhancement of WM performance.\n\nImplications - There is a great need for treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

This abnormal growth can lead to a variety of reproductive issues, including a higher risk of miscarriage and early pregnancy loss.\n\nWhile there are treatments available for adenomyosis, they are often limited due to the lack of precise diagnostic criteria. One common approach is the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), which can improve pregnancy rates in infertile women with adenomyosis.

Despite optimal treatment about 50% of eyes with nAMD develop fibrosis within 2 years, causing irreversible damage to the retina and functional loss. Objective measurement of fibrosis, however, is challenging, since clinical staging is subjective and current imaging modalities such as color fundus photography (CFP), fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) often do not allow clear delineation. Novel imaging modalities such as polarization-sensitive OCT (PS-OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA) and adaptive-optics OCT (AO-OCT) offer identification of fibrous components and microvasculature of fibrotic lesions non-invasively with highest precision and shall thus be used in this study.\n\nHypotheses: The investigators hypothesize to detect and quantify subclinical (i.e. not detectable on dilated fundus examination) areas of fibrosis using PS-OCT and determine the rate and exact location within the neovascular lesion. Furthermore, the investigators expect neuroretinal and microvascular changes, which will be assessed by AO-OCT and OCTA.\n\nMethods: Eighty eyes of 80 patients with chronic nAMD will be included and examined cross- sectionally to evaluate the accuracy of PS-OCT to detect and quantify fibrosis in comparison to gold standard imaging modalities. In addition, OCTA and AO-OCT will be performed to analyze the relationship between fibrous, neovascular and neuroretinal structures. Furthermore, forty eyes of 40 participants with treatment-na\u00efve nAMD will be included and followed over 12 months with predefined follow-up intervals. Novel non-invasive imaging will be applied to objectively determine the exact time and extent of the angiofibrotic switch in nAMD during state-of-the- art therapy. This approach has not been done before and is clinically relevant for multiple reasons: Firstly, only little is known about the development of fibrosis in AMD during therapy. Secondly, the clinical diagnosis of subretinal fibrosis is subjective and does not allow reliable quantification. Thirdly, current gold standard imaging modalities (i.e. CFP and FA) for detection of fibrosis involve invasive and time-consuming procedures and do not allow three-dimensional analysis.

Recent data showed that prevalence of SA among adolescents in Croatia and surrounding countries (i.e. former Yugoslav republics) is alarming and needs serious intervention. It is hypothesized that participation in physical-exercise-and-sport (PE\\&S) will reduce the tendency of young people to abuse substances. However, the literature to date has not consistently validated the perception PE\\&S factors are factors which could buffer SA among children and adolescents. One of the probable reasons for evident inconsistencies on findings about relationship between PE\\&S and SA is a cross-sectional nature of studies done so far.

In spite of the substantial advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis and prevention it remains one of the most common complications in conventional abdominal surgery with an incidence in the literature between 4% and 17%. As it is known that surgical sutures potentiate the development of wound infection the search for an ideal suture material, suitable for all purposes has been pursued by surgeons for decades.\n\nHypothesis: In line with in-vitro results the investigators hypothesize that the use of antibacterial skin sutures with triclosan poliglecaprone 25 reduces the rate of SSI after open abdominal surgery Methods: To prevent microbial colonization of suture material in operative wounds and therefore to prevent SSI, triclosan-coated poliglecaprone 25 suture materials with antibacterial activity will be tested against un-coated suture material for skin closure after open abdominal surgery of 200 patients. The study is planed as a single center, randomized controlled trial. After ethical approval the patients will be consecutively enrolled from 2011 to 2012 in the Department of Visceral Surgery, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The patients will be followed for 30 days (day 3,7 and 30) to detect and document wound complications. Wound complications will be classified according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention Standard guidelines. Data will be collected and the rate of SSI will be analysed in both groups.\n\nExpected value of the proposed project: If the investigators can confirm the proposed hypothesis in our study this could be a promising and feasible approach to lower SSI after open abdominal surgery and might be also used in other surgical fields. By lowering the rate of SSI the investigators might offer a new and cost saving procedure to the surgical community."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Wound Infection, Surgical"]}, "designModule": {}, "armsInterventionsModule": {}}}

People with lumbar spinal stenosis may be at increased risk of obesity given walking limitations. Spinal stenosis is a very common degenerative condition in people over 45. People with this condition have pain and numbness in the legs during walking, and therefore avoid physical activity. Lack of physical activity is related to weight gain and increased risk of chronic disease. Objective: The objective of this project is test a new e-health (online) pedometer and nutrition intervention aimed at promoting weight loss and increasing physical activity in overweight and obese individuals with spinal stenosis. Methods: The investigators will recruit 88 people with lumbar spinal stenosis who are overweight or obese. Half of these people will receive the 12-week intervention, and the other half will receive usual care (no intervention). In Weeks 1 and 6, people in the intervention group will meet with a Registered Dietitian and an Exercise Physiologist for personalized sessions. They will receive a pedometer and instructions on how to log in to the e-health site (https://sspanli.mtroyal.ca). They will wear the pedometer daily and log in to the website each week for a nutrition education session, a weekly step goal, and tips. The investigators will look to see whether people in the intervention group show greater change in physical activity, body composition and quality of life compared to the individuals who received usual care.

People with a diabetic foot ulcer have a higher risk of dying within five years than people with diabetes without an ulcer.

The reasons for this increased mortality involve decreased mobility.\n\nPeople with a recently healed diabetic foot ulcer are considered \"in remission\" as opposed to \"cured\" because the underlying medical problems which led to their ulcer are still present. Once in remission, the current standard of care is to slowly increase ambulation. The problem is that people rarely return to the recommended level of mobility. The ability to safely maintain mobility with aging is critical.\n\nThis pilot study is a small clinical trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based exercise regimen.

With the current three-week on and one week off schedule, a significant number of patients develop grade 3 or higher degree of neutropenia and require dose reduction and sometimes discontinuation. This potentially compromises the efficacy of the drug. In addition, as the half-life of palbociclib is 27 hours, 1 week break with the standard 3 weeks on and 1 week off dosing schedule could potentially lead to recovery of Rb phosphorylation during the off week. Hence, the investigators propose a 5 days on and 2 days off schedule each week without any weeks off drug. Although the cumulative doses each 28-day cycle is roughly the same with this schedule compared to conventional dosing, the bone marrow is not exposed to the drug continuously for 21 days and rather gets frequent breaks from therapy. The investigators hypothesize that the 5 days on and 2 days off schedule is more tolerable with less frequent high grade neutropenia and dose interruption/reduction.

To reduce the socioeconomic burden from the stroke survivors' loss of independence and their care (\\>HK$15 billion/year), the efficacy of rehabilitation and efficiency of its delivery must be improved. These goals can be achieved by prescribing them with individually tailored rehabilitations predicted to yield maximal functional return. Defining a predictive model for such personalization remains challenging given the immense heterogeneity of stroke. The investigators aim to build an explainable AI system that predicts a subject's recovery potential and the treatment option that may realize this potential based on multi-modal pre-rehab assessments. Data from clinical, neuroimaging, neurophysiological, and multi-omic evaluations will be collected from stroke survivors (N\u2265400) before they undergo upper limb rehab with usual care, neuromuscular stimulation, robotic training, or acupuncture. Machine learning-extracted data features will be used to train decision-tree and neural-network AI algorithms for robust predictions. As soon as the model is validated, the investigators will deploy it to implement a personalized rehab program in the community. Our model's ability to predict the optimal intervention from a wide spectrum of input modalities distinguishes ours from previous less-than-accurate models. Our interdisciplinary team of 13 PIs with expertise in neurology, PT/OT, acupuncture, electrical/biomed. engineering, robotics, neuroscience, neuroimaging, multi-omics, data science, and clinical trial management will put us in a world-unique position to execute this project successfully and generate opportunities of interdisciplinary education.

Cervical cancer is still the major health problem in the developing countries. It has been the first rank women's cancer in Thailand for many decades. Approximately 10-20% of Thai women have the high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infections in their cervices. This will frequently lead to low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) (10%), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) (0.8%), and finally, cervical cancers (0.16%) within 10-20 years. The treatment options for LSILs are either observation or ablative surgery. However, in our institute, cryotherapy, which is the one of ablative surgery, is more frequently used to comfort our women. It is not only effective but safe with only minimal side effects; watery leukorrhea for 2-4 weeks, and local cervical infection not more than 1%. Contraindication to this procedure are active cervical infection, lesion of 2 mm-larger than probe, lesion inside cervical os and suspected cervical cancer. Additionally, in developing countries such as Thailand, this treatment is safe, acceptable, feasible and effective. Patients with LSILs could also have this treatment in some rural area from the 10-days trained nurses. Fortunately, recent reports showed that cryotherapy has abilities not only in clearing LSILs but also clearing the HPV infections, its necessary cause. However, there are no randomized controlled trial compared its clearing ability between observation and cryotherapy. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial is needed to demonstrate that. Findings from this trial will contribute enormously to older women who already get infected by HPV. Aside from preventing cervical cancer in treated woman, cryotherapy could also give her relief from worrying about having a time-bomb like HPV infection in her cervix."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Human Papillomavirus Clearance at 12 Months"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "PROCEDURE", "name": "Cryotherapy", "description": "Double freezing technique", "armGroupLabels": ["A"], "otherNames": ["Cryosurgery"]}]}}}

They reduce a person's risk of heart failure, renal failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and potentially all-cause mortality. Remarkably, some of these benefits also extend to people who do not have T2DM. While the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are impressive, there is one life-threatening side effect associated with their use: diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The ability to predict which patients are at highest risk of DKA is needed to sufficiently mitigate this risk. Moreover, considering the impressive benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors, identifying patients at the lowest risk of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA is also important so that providers do not overestimate risk in those who stand to benefit most.\n\nAdvances in genomic technologies and related analyses have provided unprecedented opportunities to bring genomics-driven precision medicine initiatives to the forefront of clinical research. Leading these developments has been the progress made by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) due to decreasing genotyping costs, and consequently, the ability to routinely study large numbers of patients. These approaches allow for systematic screening of the genome in an unbiased manner and have accelerated the discovery of genetic variants and novel biological processes that contribute to the development of adverse treatment outcomes.\n\nBy using innovative approaches, which harness large cohorts of population controls, sample size limitations that are associated with rare adverse drug reactions such as SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA can be overcome.

After the introduction of silastic catheters in the 1970's this method became the treatment of choice for children and adults with communicating hydrocephalus. The average patient necessitating VPS will undergo at least two shunt revisions every three years, with some patients requiring more than twenty revisions within the first year. Therefore, any technical improvement with a positive impact on the revision rate not only benefits the patient through a reduction of the surgical burden but may also have economic advantages.\n\nDistal shunt failures - either due to improper placement or secondary dislocation of the distal catheter out of the peritoneal cavity - have been reported in 10-30% of cases. Catheter placement in obese patients and in patients with adhesions owing to previous abdominal surgery remains challenging. Most neurosurgeons will carry out a mini-laparotomy to allow for the placement of the distal catheter end within the peritoneal cavity, which rarely requires the help of a general or visceral surgeon.\n\nAn alternative to laparotomy is the laparoscopic placement of the peritoneal catheter in VPS. Retrospective series have since shown the safety of this procedure and suggested an advantage of laparoscopic VPS in terms of operation duration, length of hospital stay and the rate of distal (and thus potentially overall) shunt dysfunction.\n\nThe evidence concerning the effect of laparoscopic surgery for VPS placement is so far based on non-randomized studies, in which a selection bias may have influenced the outcomes."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Ventricular Peritoneal Shunt", "Shunt Complications", "Shunt Failure", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "designModule": {}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "PROCEDURE", "name": "VP Shunt Surgery for laparoscopic insertion of the peritoneal catheter", "description": "Patients in this Study Arm will receive a VP Shunt inserted laparoscopically", "armGroupLabels": ["1"]}, {"type": "PROCEDURE", "name": "VP Shunt Surgery for open insertion of the peritoneal catheter", "description": "Patients in this Study Arm will receive a VP Shunt inserted openly", "armGroupLabels": ["2"]}]}}}

Nowadays, very few studies in France have evaluated the prevalence of hepatitis C in a psychiatric environment.\n\nIn 2019, at the time of new treatments for HCV, it therefore seems essential to update the available data by estimating the prevalence of chronic active hepatitis C in psychiatric population. In addition to an update of epidemiological data, it is of high importance to assess the effectiveness of the care pathway for patients in whom chronic active hepatitis C is diagnosed, including the cascade of care, currently too inefficient despite treatments that are themselves ultra-efficient. Indeed, it is essential that once hepatitis is detected, it is formally diagnosed, then that the patient actually starts care and is adherent to treatment (take his treatment according to the prescription and until the end: this implies that the patient accepts his or her illness and understands the value of the prescribed treatments), to hope to cure the infection.\n\nIn this context, the SaPHIR study will allow to test a systematic screening of patients in an adult psychiatric environment, through rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). The objective is to promote the adherence of patients, and to assess possible obstacles in order to optimize the screening (RDTs), diagnosis (confirmation of only positive RDTs by venous sampling) and care management circuits in routine practice. In addition, the study envisages a combined HCV-HBV-HIV screening, taking into account the cross-infection risk (same mode of contamination, same risk population, frequent co-infections, more severe liver pathology in case of co-infection, etc.), thus making it possible to take care of the patient as a whole.

It is transparent to allow light into the eye and its shape focuses the incoming light onto the retina. The cornea is responsible for two-thirds of this focusing, while the human lens accounts for the remaining third.\n\nKeratoconus is a condition with onset in the second to third decades of life, where the cornea warps into an irregular shape. This irregularity reduces vision due to blurring of the image focused on the retina. Only partial improvement is achievable with traditional glasses because the corneal shape becomes irregular.\n\nThe glasses prescriptions of patients with keratoconus often differ significantly from the measurements obtained from the cornea in a clinical setting. The predictability of the magnitude and variability of this disparity is poorly understood. As a result, determining the optimal glasses prescription for achieving the best vision correction often involves a time-consuming trial-and-error approach. Improved predictability could reduce the time required to identify the optimal glasses prescription, thereby increasing productivity. For surgical patients, better predictability would enable surgeons to select lenses that provide superior vision outcomes after treatment. In the optometry clinic at the West of England Eye Unit, a database of over 800 patients with glasses prescriptions and corresponding corneal scans has been compiled by the investigators.

The pathogenesis of urinary calculi is not completely clear. Supersaturation of urinary components is a necessary condition for the formation of urinary calculi. The causes of stone formation are closely related to diet, drugs, metabolic disorders, basic diseases, genetic factors, environment and so on. Diet essentially determines the composition of urine, which affects the formation of urinary calculi. The effect of dietary phosphorus intake on stones is not clear. There is a lack of data to support dietary phosphorus as an influencing factor of stone formation. Phosphorus is present in most foods. 24h urine composition analysis is of great value in predicting the occurrence and composition of urinary calculi. However, due to the interaction between urine components, a single urine component can not well predict the occurrence of stones. Therefore, the researchers introduced the relative supersaturation of common stone components in urine to predict the incidence of stones. Therefore, we want to give healthy adults a diet with different phosphorus content for a period of time to clarify the effect of phosphorus in the diet on 24h urine composition level and urine relative supersaturation, so as to further explore the relationship between dietary phosphorus and the incidence of urinary calculi.

Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow and blood stream that develop into blood cells. Stem cells transplanted from a healthy donor travel to the patient's bone marrow and begin producing normal cells. In patients with certain cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, the donor's immune cells attack the patient's cancer cells in what is called a \"graft-versus-tumor\" effect, contributing to cure of the disease. This study will determine whether this treatment can be used successfully to treat patients with sarcomas.\n\nPatients between 4 and 35 years of age with a sarcoma that has spread from the primary site or cannot be removed surgically, and for whom effective treatment is not available, may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have been diagnosed by the age of 30 at the time of enrollment. They must have a matched donor (usually a sibling). Participants undergo the following procedures:\n\nDonors: Stem cells are collected from the donor. To do this, the hormone granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is injected under the skin for several days to move stem cells out of the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Then, the cells are collected by apheresis. In this procedure the blood is drawn through a needle placed in one arm and pumped into a machine where the stem cells are separated out and removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm.\n\nPatients: For patients who do not already have a central venous catheter (plastic tube), one is placed into a major vein. This tube can stay in the body the entire treatment period for giving medications, transfusing blood, , withdrawing blood samples, and delivering the donated stem cells. Before the transplant procedure, patients receive from one to three cycles of \"induction\" chemotherapy, with each cycle consisting of 5 days of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone followed by at least a 17-day rest period. All the drugs are infused through the catheter except prednisone, which is taken by mouth. After the induction therapy, the patient is admitted to the hospital for 5 days of chemotherapy with high doses of cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and fludarabine. Two days later, the stem cells are infused. The anticipated hospital stay is about 3 weeks, but may be longer if complications arise. Patients are discharged when their white cell count is near normal, they have no fever or infection, they can take sufficient food and fluids by mouth, and they have no signs of serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-a condition in which the donor's cells \"see\" the patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response against them.\n\nAfter hospital discharge, patients are followed in the clinic at least once or twice weekly for a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests for 100 days. They receive medications to prevent infection and GVHD and, if needed, blood transfusions. If GVHD has not developed by about 120 days post transplant, patients receive additional white cells to boost the immune response. After 100 days, follow-up visits may be less frequent. Follow-up continues for at least 5 years. During the course of the study, patients undergo repeated medical evaluations, including blood tests and radiology studies, to check on the cancer and on any treatment side effects. On four occasions, white blood cells may be collected through apheresis to see if immune responses can be generated against the sarcomas treated in this study. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be done on five occasions.

Treatments for most medical conditions can help us lead longer and healthier lives, but there are still problems. Many patients with two or more conditions see many different doctors and sometimes take more medications than needed. These patients can feel lost and confused. In addition, non-medical issues involving housing, food, transportation, employment, income, support from others, and language barriers can have a large impact on our health.\n\nIn Minnesota, many primary care clinics are using a method called care coordination to improve the health of patients who have a number of chronic diseases (some examples of chronic diseases include diabetes, heart disease, asthma and depression). With care coordination, a nurse in the clinic helps the various doctors, clinics, and specialists to work together, in the interest of the patient. In some clinics, a social worker also helps with care coordination. These social workers help with issues like housing, transportation, or employment. Care coordination can help reduce patient confusion. It also can improve health and lower patient burdens and costs of getting medical care.\n\nTo help find out what types of care coordination are most successful, we are proposing a study. Our plan is to track the health of patients receiving care coordination and compare two types:\n\nA. Care coordination done by a nurse or other clinic staff B. Care coordination where a licensed social worker also assists the patient\n\nIn this study, we will measure many things, including:\n\n1. Control of chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and depression\n2. Hospitalizations\n3. Emergency department visits\n4. Use of medications and diagnostic tests\n5. Use of specialty care\n6. General health status\n7. Patient satisfaction and access to care\n8. Use of shared decision-making (where the doctor and the patient make treatment decisions together)\n9. Patient burden (how much time and effort the patient spends trying to get healthy)\n10. Patients' out-of-pocket medical costs\n\nThis project will be important to patients because it could reduce confusion and fragmented care while improving all the items above. Those improvements will be more likely because this project takes advantage of engagement with patients and others. We have four patient partners who will help conduct the study and interpret and broadly share the results. The project was developed with the input from patients, clinic leaders, people from state government, and experts on health and quality care.\n\nBy measuring a wide variety of outcomes for the adults receiving coordination services in these clinics, we hope to identify the specific actionable information that will allow these and other clinics to improve their services for these patients with complex needs.\n\nThroughout the project, we will communicate our findings to clinics and health systems.

Since the introduction to the vaccination schedule of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) live attenuated vaccine directed towards tuberculosis prevention, a decrease in infant mortality has been reported, not related only to tuberculosis. BCG vaccine has been hypothesized to have a non-specific role towards other unrelated pathogens such as viruses that cause airway disease, with reduced morbidity and mortality. In murine as well as in human models it has been shown to decrease the incidence of acute respiratory influenza infections. Likewise, in countries with a high endemicity for tuberculosis, the BCG vaccine reduces the incidence of respiratory infections by up to 80% . In healthy subjects, the BCG vaccine increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines in monocytes. Likewise, it increases the epigenetic response, causing an increase in the transcription of genes important in the antimicrobial response, as well as an improvement in cellular function.

Previously, imbalance of the different quadriceps muscle heads was believed to be a causative factor of patellar malignment. However, findings from electromyography studies on quadriceps activities and patellar alignment in the last two decades were inconsistent. In order to better understand the relationship between quadriceps muscle imbalance and patellar malalignment, shear wave elastography (SWE), which can measure the passive and active muscle stiffness, may shed some new lights to this area. This study aims to examine whether the quadriceps muscle stiffness can predict the patellar position. The healthy young adult will be recruited in this study. Active and passive quadriceps muscle stiffness will be measured with the SWE in different conditions and the result will be correlated with the patellar position measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Also, electromyography (EMG) activity will be measured during the active stiffness measurement so as to establish the level of agreement between the EMG and SWE data. Linear regression will be used to calculate the relationship between different factors. The total number of subjects needed will be 55 by setting an effect size of 0.15 with two predictors, 80% power, and \u03b1 at 0.05 in the linear regression.\n\nThis project will be conducted at PolyU campus and an MRI clinic in Hong Kong.

Sensor Augmented Pump has demonstrated superiority over insulin pump and Multiple Daily Injection (MDI) in achieving optimal glucose control and can improve quality of life in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients. Hybrid closed loop (HCL) insulin pump Minimed 670G is a FDA approved device and European Conformity (CE) mark with SmartGuard technology and closed loop algorithm, which will allow the patients to improve their diabetes management. Hybrid closed loop insulin pump Minimed 670G monitors glucose in the subcutaneous tissues and automatically adjusts the delivery of rapid acting insulin as basal rate based on the user's glucose reading. SmartGuard technology in insulin pump, based on user's sensor glucose values can predict when glucose is approaching low levels, 30 minutes in advance and automatically stop insulin delivery. When user's glucose levels recover, SmartGuard will automatically resume insulin delivery. CareLink is personal software, which downloads the data from insulin pump, glucose sensor and glucometer to visualize diabetes information with charts, statistics and events that help patient and health provider to identify and understand patterns and trends The objective of this study is to assess structured group education on boarding protocol of the HCL Minimed 670 G in achieving glucose control of patients on MDI.\n\nMethods. This study is a single-arm, single-center, clinical investigation in subjects with type 1 diabetes on HCL insulin pump (Minimed 670G) in a period of 3 months. A total of 30 subjects (age 6 - 17) will be enrolled in order to reach 26 subjects who will complete the HCL study. The investigators will start the clinical process for initiating an insulin pump, which is typically done with pre-pump classes. HbA1c, derived from CGM will be performed at baseline and 3 months during the study. The following parameters will be analyzed: % patients achieving Time in Range (TIR) \\> 67% from 70 mg/dl to 180 mg/dl; % patients achieving TIR \\<3%, below time in range (\\<70 mg/dl) and % patients achieving both TIR \\> 67% and \\<3% time below Range.

Specifically, we wish to assess the (1) sustained virologic response (SVR) of HCV in both populations, (2) incidence of HBsAg loss and HBsAg seroconversion (HBsAg loss and appearance of anti-HBs) in dually infected population, (3) ALT normalization or flare off-treatment during both populations, (4) reductions of HCV RNA from the original baseline levels in the two patient populations, and (5) reduction of serum HBV DNA off-treatment in the dually infected population."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Coinfection With Hepatitis B Virus and Hepatitis C Virus", "Monoinfection With Hepatitis C Virus"]}, "designModule": {}}}

Traditional treatment methods include autologous bone grafts, allografts, and distraction osteogenesis. Autologous bone grafting is often considered the gold standard due to its superior biological compatibility, but it is limited by complications such as donor site morbidity and the finite quantity of available graft material. Allografts provide an alternative but are associated with risks of immune rejection and disease transmission. Distraction osteogenesis, popularized by Ilizarov, allows for gradual bone regeneration and lengthening but requires prolonged treatment periods and carries the risk of complications like pin tract infections.\n\nIn the late 1990s, titanium mesh cages, particularly the Harms cage, emerged as a novel solution for meta-diaphyseal bone defects. Originally developed for spinal surgery, these cages were adapted for long bone reconstruction due to their structural stability and biocompatibility. The cylindrical design of titanium mesh cages provides mechanical support while allowing for the containment of bone graft material and promoting vascular ingrowth. This technique enables effective reconstruction of segmental defects by combining the cage with cancellous bone grafts or other substitutes.\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated promising outcomes with titanium mesh cages in treating meta-diaphyseal defects. High union rates and favorable functional results have been reported in long-term follow-ups. The method offers advantages such as immediate structural stability and adaptability to various clinical scenarios, making it a valuable option for addressing complex bone defects. However, like all techniques, it is not without limitations, including potential complications such as residual limb length discrepancies or recurrent infections in some cases.

However, octreotide LAR causes gastrointestinal side effects and the injection solution is difficult to prepare. Recently, a new somatostatin analogue with a prolonged release formulation, Lanreotide autogel (L-autogel), has become available. It is a viscous aqueous gel, composed solely of water and lanreotide. Deep subcutaneous administration may lead to increased treatment acceptance compared with intramuscular depot preparations. It is more easy to prepare and is though to cause less local side effects and technical problems than octreotide LAR. Recent studies have been done to measure the efficacy and safety of L-autogel in acromegalic treated previously with octreotide LAR. These studies showed that L-autogel is effective and well-tolerated in these patients, with equivalent or better disease control and less gastrointestinal adverse events.

Prepubertal children experience changes in physical growth. During the prepubertal phase, engaging in regular physical activity can lead to substantial improvements in cardiovascular health, muscular strength, agility, and coordination. Physical fitness has been recognized as a key determinant in healthy lifestyles based increasingly on criteria referenced to general health. However, many children and adolescents are only exposed to vigorous physical activity during school based physical education classes. That way, schools seem to provide an excellent setting to enhance physical activity and physical fitness levels. Soccer, a widely popular sport, offers an engaging and enjoyable way for children to improve their physical fitness and gross motor coordination.\n\nThis study aims to investigate the effects of recreational soccer training on physical fitness and gross motor coordination in prepubertal boys and girls and to compare the effects of recreational soccer training between boys and girls. This current study will be a clinical trial; data will be calculated from Dar-e-Arqam School, upper mall Lahore. A total of 70 prepubertal children (35 boys and 35 girls) will be recruited for this study. Inclusion criteria for the study will be 7 to 9 years old boys and girls. participants should be in good general health, without any medical condition that could affect their ability to participate in physical activities. Individuals with physical disabilities or impairments that prevent them from engaging in soccer activities will be excluded. Participants will be divided into two experimental groups: Group A (boys) and Group B (girls). Both groups will undergo the same soccer training program. The soccer training program will consist of sessions held thrice a week for 8 weeks, each lasting 60 minutes.Outcomes to be analyzed will be Physical fitness and Gross motor coordination.

The use of ultrasound to guide epidural insertion and placement has been shown to improve pain relief and reduce the risk of complications.\n\nHowever, after identifying the desired needle insertion site via ultrasound, current practice involves demarcating the insertion site using marker pens, which is time-consuming, inaccurate, and may be inadvertently removed by skin sterilisation. Furthermore, the desired needle angulation determined by ultrasound cannot be accurately measured and maintained during the epidural procedure. Both issues limit the benefits of using ultrasound to guide the epidural procedure.\n\nTo address these issues, the investigators developed a Position and Angular Marking System (PAMS) that attaches on to the ultrasound probe. When the desired insertion site is identified by ultrasound, the doctor gently presses PAMS into the patient's back to create skin indentations demarcating the needle insertion point. These indentations are not affected by skin sterilisation, and may improve accuracy and reduce the time taken to perform the epidural procedure. Next, the angle between the ultrasound probe and the patient's back can be measured using PAMS, and this angle can be maintained using a needle guide during the epidural procedure.\n\nThe purpose of this randomised study is to evaluate the usability of PAMS and to identify areas for further improvement.\n\nThis study will involve up to 10 healthy simulated patients, and up to 30 volunteer ultrasound operators. After undergoing a standardised training session with a mannequin, the ultrasound operators will be randomly assigned to perform skin marking on the simulated patients as though they are performing an ultrasound-guided epidural anaesthesia procedure (no needle puncture will be made) using either PAMS, or standard clinical practice with marker pens.

Various studies evaluated the application of DW-MRI to diffuse liver disease and focal liver lesions providing controversial results, probably due to the difficult reproducibility of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements. It is conceivable that a wide inter/intra-individual variability actually exists in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-values, and that each apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-value presents an higher reliability in measuring the temporal changes of water diffusion within the same individual (longitudinal-evaluation), than in characterizing tissues between different patients (transverse-evaluation). For these reasons, some previous studies assessed the application of DW-MRI in predicting the chemotherapy (CHT) outcome in liver metastases.

Insulin resistant women will have greater \u03bc-opioid receptor availability at baseline, and a larger response to stress challenge than non-insulin resistant women\n2.

A short (3-5 day) course of a short-acting steroid such as Prednisone or Prednisolone has long been the standard of care for asthma exacerbation. Dexamethasone efficacy in asthma exacerbation has been studied in the outpatient setting and was found to be as effective as Prednisone. Dexamethasone has the advantage of shorter course, more compliance, and more tolerable. This has led many emergency departments to provide a 1-2 dose course of Dexamethasone on discharge. Thus, many inpatients have received a first dose of Dexamethasone prior to reaching the inpatient unit, leading to confusion about the best plan for these patients. Many hospitalist pediatricians continue to give a 5-day total course with Prednisone, but some patients have begun to receive a second dose of Dexamethasone 24 hours after the first dose. To our knowledge, no studies have been done to compare the efficacy of these two protocols in pediatric patients requiring hospitalization. The hypothesis is that a second dose of Dexamethasone is as effective as four additional days of Prednisone in hospitalized children with asthma exacerbation.

Most common protocols recommend heparin infusions after surgery with transition to oral aspirin when oral intake begins. Patients at risk for thrombosis after congenital heart surgery requiring long-term antiplatelet therapy include those undergoing shunt placement for single-ventricle palliation or establishment of pulmonary blood flow, valve replacements, or coronary artery manipulation. Post-operative thrombosis after congenital heart surgery is rare, but thrombosis can result in death. The routine use of aspirin in these patients is intended to prevent the potentially catastrophic consequences of thrombosis. However, there is no routine clinical assessment of the platelet inhibitory effect of aspirin; nor have there been any prospective studies to assess the effectiveness of aspirin's antiplatelet effect in children after congenital heart surgery. No data exists to suggest that the first dose of aspirin transition from heparin infusion is either sufficient or insufficient in its antiplatelet effect.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the first aspirin dose in its antiplatelet effects after surgery for congenital heart disease. Degree of antiplatelet effect will be evaluated with thromboelastograph (TEG) and TEG-platelet mapping study analysis. Thromboelastography is a clinical laboratory method of assessing whole blood hemostasis and allows for assessment of clot formation, strength, and stability. TEG is most commonly used in patients at risk for bleeding or thrombosis and also to monitor antiplatelet therapies (such as aspirin).\n\nThe investigators hypothesize: the first dose of aspirin transitioned from heparin infusion after congenital heart surgery is sufficient in its antiplatelet effect as tested by TEG and TEG-platelet mapping studies. Confirmation of the antiplatelet effect of aspirin will help support the current practice of empiric aspirin therapy to prevent post-operative thrombosis in children after congenital heart surgery."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Congenital Heart Disease"]}, "designModule": {}}}

In addition resting 12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained on a daily basis, and a 24-hour ST-segment ambulatory monitoring will be performed once within the first week of hospitalisation. Finally, myocardial perfusion patterns during rest will be evaluated by means of a myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients with an elevated troponin T level.\n\nSix months later control measurements of troponin T, CK-MB and NT-proBNP and a 12-lead ECG will be obtained.\n\nExpectations\n\nThe study will contribute with original observations in patients with acute ischemic stroke considering the following issues:\n\n1.

Have an ameliorating effect on physical and psychological symptoms during chemotherapy treatment\n2. May counteract the patients feeling of loss of identity and alienation in this particular group of cancer patients.\n3. Is more effective in patients with good musical abilities.\n4.

Listening to patient-preferred taped music during chemotherapy\n3. Standard care\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary: Level of anxiety measured by STAI. Secondary: Serum catecholamines.\n\nBackground: In order to establish the intervention procedures, the investigators have carried out a pilot study at the hematology department at Hospital of Southwest Denmark, including students from the Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts, Southern Denmark. The pilot results indicates that live music has an uplifting, pain relieving, and then releasing effect and that music has a positive impact on hospitalisation. According to the evaluation forms filled out by 243 cancer patients, the music experience has provided human anchorage/cohesion as a counterweight to disease fixation and alienation Chemotherapy involves major physical and psychological problems. Not much has been provided in the clinical setting which relieves the symptoms of anxiety associated with chemotherapy. A review of the literature illustrate the need for developing new potential areas of intervention that takes into account, that not only do cancer patients face challenges in everyday life ranging from physiological changes over social to psychological problems, but also during treatment procedures, which may cause a higher level of anxiety associated with these procedures, e.g., chemotherapy infusion.This project investigates to what degree live music may relieve some of these symptoms during treatment for haematological cancer. The project is created in order to both measure psychosocial effects as well as direct stress measures, i.e. serum catecholamine. These physiological changes are measured in order to shed light on the mechanism behind the potential effects of live music on discomfort in connection with chemotherapy treatment.\n\nPerspectives: The vision of the project focus on strengthening the cancer patients' ability to cope with physiological and psychological issues during chemotherapy sessions and to make the patients conscious of music as an option in these coping efforts. Hopefully, the results will provide a scientific basis for an evaluation of the perspectives and the potentials of live music treatment during chemotherapy infusion among cancer patients."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Non Hodgkin\u00b4s Lymphomas", "Hodgkin\u00b4s Lymphomas"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Live music", "armGroupLabels": ["Live music"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "Taped music", "armGroupLabels": ["Taped music"]}]}}}

Activation of mirror neurons strengthens voluntary motor movement by strengthening the affected nerve pathways or by creating alternative pathways. AOT is an easily applicable method as telerehabilitation because it is based on watching and replaying video recordings. Virtual Rehabilitation (VR); It is another treatment approach applied to improve the motor functions of children with CP and created with the contribution of developing technology. It has been reported that activities have a positive effect on motor learning due to their intense, task-oriented, active participation and high motivation.

The anxiety of the children is related to parent's separation, loss of self-control, unknown surroundings and strange people that are taking care of them, and frequently unpleasant or even painful procedures. Painful and frightening procedures in children have been shown to result in short-term physiologic changes and long-term behavioral changes. The response to unpleasant stimuli with stress and fear may be exaggerated in children and experienced as pain. Most infants and children and many teenagers need deep sedation or light general anesthesia to complete a successful and safe procedure. Induction of general anesthesia is a stressful procedure itself. Strategies to reduce preanesthesia anxiety include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions.\n\nHowever, this evidence is based mainly on self reports rather than objective measurements. Therefore, objective and non-invasive measurements to be utilized in the current study, should provide an assessment tools regardless the children's age.\n\nMultiple studies, beginning in the 1970's, have shown that humor has many positive effects on physical and mental health and well-being. Previous investigations have reported that humor has beneficial effects on the immune system, stress related to potentially fatal illnesses, pain tolerance, and mental functions.\n\nDream doctors (DDs) are professional medical clowns or stage artists, who received training specifically to understand medical patient's need and to give the patient adjuvant therapy during hospital admissions or ambulatory treatment.The Israel dream doctors project, integrates professional medical clowning into the medical services provided at Israeli hospitals.Studies already proved that presence of medical clowns significantly reduces the level of anxiety during induction of anesthesia in children.

This approach has reduced maternal morbidity rates. including less blood loss, fewer transfusion requirements and, intraoperative urinary tract injury as well as improve fetal outcome.\n\nUltrasound evaluation is the recommended first-line modality for diagnosing PAS. Ultrasound features suggestive of PAS include loss of the normal retroplacental clear zone, attenuation of the uterine-bladder interface, reduced retroplacental myometrial thickness, presence of intraplacental lacunar spaces, and bridging vessels between the placenta and bladder. A systematic review reported that the antenatal diagnosis of PAS significantly lowered the rate of urinary tract injury (from 63% to 39%) during cesarean hysterectomies in these cases.\n\nUnlike other elective cesarean hysterectomies, cesarean hysterectomy with a placenta previa increta/percreta, is more difficult. There is a greater need to both keep a margin from the vascular cervical-placental mass and simultaneously protect the urinary bladder. Case series reported that bladder filling helps the surgeon to more clearly identify the planes of dissection and secure the engorged aberrant vessels, thereby reduces bladder injury.

The impact of these disorders on workers is considerable, particularly in terms of pain, disability and reduced quality of life. Several occupational factors may explain the onset of these disorders, such as changes in the work environment, physical demands, psychosocial factors specific to the occupational context and the age of workers. The lack of quantitative measurement tools to assess the physical demands of work over an extended period of time is sorely felt. Recently, our team developed a wearable feedback device, similar to a watch worn on the arm, which measures shoulder movements and muscle activity, transforming this real-time data into clinical indicators. These indicators provide immediate feedback to workers, enabling them to better understand the physical demands of their tasks and adapt accordingly. If this device proves effective in reducing physical demands, it could become a valuable tool for guiding workplace assessments and interventions. However, this device has not yet been tested on workers with shoulder pain. For this reason, a two-part pilot study is needed to understand user needs, assess ease of use and the feasibility of implementing the device. The first component will consist of a pilot clinical trial involving 42 workers suffering from shoulder pain, divided into two groups: one group will use the feedback device for 2 weeks, while the other group will continue to work without intervention.

This seems to be a common problem in the case of patients under general anesthesia, besides surgery trauma and general anesthetics may change sleep function and sleep cycle perioperatively, the postoperative complications such as pain, nausea and vomiting etc after general anesthesia may also reduce postoperative sleep quality.Flurbiprofen axetil is a new non-steroidal anti infection analgesic(NSAIDs), which is widely used for analgesia to reduce the dose of opioids and the occurrence of adverse reactions, such as declined sleep quality, respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting . Preemptive analgesia is an analgesic intervention that begins before surgery to prevent the nervous system from becoming sensitive to subsequent stimuli that may aggravate pain. A large number of experimental studies have shown that use flurbiprofen axetil preoperatively is better than use it postoperatively. However, limited information was reported before on the effect of factors such as age, gender, preoperative negative mood such as anxiety and depression, type and length of surgery, which could influence postoperative pain and analgesic consumption and the association between postoperative sleep quality and postoperative pain intensity.

The anatomical regions of the intervertebral disc include the central nucleus pulposus, the peripheral fibrocartilaginous annulus fibrosus, and the superior and inferior cartilaginous endplates (CEP). The CEP is a thin layer of hyaline cartilage located between the avascular intervertebral disc and the bony vertebral endplate. The endplate cartilage consists of chondrocytes interspersed throughout an extracellular matrix of proteoglycans, collagen (types I and II), and water. It plays an important role in the function and homeostasis. The CEP has been considered the pathway between the largely avascular disk tissues and the blood supply of the vertebral body and thus provides nutrition for disk cells. Many musculoskeletal tissues, including the CEP, cartilage-bone interface of articular joints, entheses, tendons, and ligaments, have components with very short T2 values (much less than 1 msec), which are orders of magnitude shorter than that of the nucleus of the disk (\\~100 msec). In a conventional pulse sequence, such as proton density-weighted spin-echo (SE) or fast SE, with standard clinical section profile, the minimum echo time (TE) is typically 10 msec, which is much longer than that needed to capture the short-lived signal from these tissues. Recently, ultrashort echo sequence UTE technology has been introduced, and the TE time can be as low as 0.008ms. This range of TE is sufficient to capture signals from the cartilage endplate before it decays. With using new MRI technology, such as IR-UTE, UTE-MT, UTE-T2\\*mapping, Maigc, DTI, and IVIM, which can quantitative tissues that have previously been \"invisible\" at conventional MR imaging, and provide imaging basis for early diagnosis of injury at molecular level.

Consequently, it is also of great importance for athletes since it is seen that injuries in clinics are predominantly monitored in young individuals, who do active sports. Anterior cruciate ligament injuries commonly occur in football players when a secondary task (motor or cognitive) is involved while they are busy with a motor activity. In these processes, a circumstance, in which there becomes a quick landing after a jump or a difficult pass whilst dribbling the ball, can be monitored. In such cases, the subject of preventing these injuries, which may occur in athletes, and making them ready for second tasks after the treatment of the injury, has become a current issue. It is important for individuals who have suffered the injury- to be able to bring the knee joint to its former function at the highest level after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. As a result, the development of novel rehabilitation strategies has been an ongoing focus of research. A prime exemplar of this phenomenon is the implementation of dual-task exercises. Dual-task exercises appear in athletes as motor-cognitive or motor-motor. Athletes' exercising motor-cognitive functions has attracted the attention of researchers in the past period to prevent injuries in sports and has brought a new breath to the academic world. Studies suggest a decrease in cognitive and motor functions in the acute period after injuries. However, observing its long-term effects, they also suggest an increase in the attention parameter, crucial for athletes.\n\nIn a study examining postural stability in individuals, who underwent an operation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by giving motor-motor or motor-cognitive exercises, it is seen that worse results are obtained in postural stability in individuals, who underwent only anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, in cases -in which eyes were closed and dual motor tasks were given-, more negative results are obtained compared to the open-eyed group. It is associated with a significant decrease in proprioceptive performance in individuals after anterior cruciate ligament injury. Owing to this decrease, postural control decreases, and negative situations arise due to the pathology of the individual. The star balance test is a sensitive test to determine and emerges as an exercise that will correct this negative situation. Post-ACL injury, individuals exhibit significantly lower physical component scores in quality-of-life assessments compared to healthy controls, as reported in books and articles. Moreover, after the ACL reconstruction, a decrease in the mental scores of the individual is seen owing to reasons such as long-term absenteeism from work, rehabilitation, the high costs of the operation, and traumatic occasions.\n\nFoam roller, one of the current treatment modalities, is a myofascial release technique. The purpose of the foam roller application is to activate myofascial release by using the athlete's body weight and back-and-forth movement cycle. It has been observed that the usage of foam roller delays the emergence of delayed muscle soreness with myofascial release in the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, while also increasing joint range of motion. Despite the widespread utilization of foam rollers in clinical practice, empirical evidence elucidating the underlying mechanisms and clinical efficacy of this modality remains relatively limited. Nevertheless, the factors -which are consequential in the return to pre-injury performance of the athletes- have not been thoroughly scrutinized. For instance, there is no encounter in the literature examining the effects of dual-task exercises on kinesiophobia, ACL-specific quality of life, star balance test evaluation, normal range of motion evaluation, Tegner-Lysholm knee scoring scale.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to compare two different rehabilitation groups in terms of pain, range of motion, functionality, balance, quality of life, and kinesiophobia in individuals who underwent ACL reconstruction. The first group is the one with a dual-task approach given during walking and balance exercises together with the conventional physiotherapy program. The latter is the one with the same dual-task approach given during walking and balance exercises together, as an extra with a foam roller."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "EXERCISE", "description": "Conventional Physiotherapy + Dual-Task Approach During Walking and Balance Exercises:", "armGroupLabels": ["EXERCISE GROUP", "FOAM ROLLER GROUP"]}]}}}

Although surgery and anesthesia techniques have improved in recent years, sleep function and sleep cycles may still be altered perioperatively by surgery and other interventions under general anesthesia.Postoperative sleep fragmentation and poor sleep quality not only lead to hyperalgesia and delayed postoperative recovery, but can increase the risk of potential adverse effects, such as cognitive impairment, chronic pain and emotional disturbances, metabolic disorders, and pro-inflammatory changes. General anesthesia is a medically induced state of hyporesponsiveness that resembles natural sleep. Studies have shown that general anesthesia can lead to circadian rhythm time structure dyssynchrony, resulting in postoperative sleep disturbance, characterized by decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave sleep (SWS). Previous studies have also reported that age, preoperative comorbidities, and severity of surgical trauma are independent factors associated with postoperative sleep disturbance. In addition, anxiety is an unpleasant sensation that compromises patients' comfort and well-being. A study by Ruis et al. estimated that 25-80% of patients admitted for surgery experienced preoperative anxiety, including fear of surgery and anesthesia-related fears. Furthermore, preoperative anxiety was recognized as a potential and preventable risk factor for severe postoperative pain and postoperative complications such as increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Given that several prior studies have reported that preoperative anxiety has an effect on postoperative sleep quality in patients undergoing gynecological surgery, this study aimed to investigate the effect of preoperative anxiety on postoperative outcomes and sleep quality in patients undergoing gynecological surgery. Studying these results could enable us to better manage patients during the perioperative period to promote their postoperative recovery."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["General Anesthesia", "Postoperative Pain", "Postoperative Sleep Quality", "Preoperative Anxiety"]}, "designModule": {}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "PROCEDURE", "name": "patients undergoing gynecological surgery under general anesthesia", "description": "patients undergoing gynecological surgery under general anesthesia", "armGroupLabels": ["Non-preoperative anxiety group", "preoperative anxiety group"]}]}}}

But withdrawing treatment can be risky. In patients on a curative dose of anticoagulant medicine, treatment withdrawal heightens the risk of thromboembolic events occurring, with potentially major consequences. For instance, mechanical valve thrombosis is fatal in 15% of patients. Resumption of anticoagulation is therefore critical in patients at high risk for thromboembolic events.\n\nHowever, in these patients having presented major h\u00e6morrhage, resumption of anticoagulation heightens the risk of h\u00e6morrhage recurrence. This risk is even higher when the original h\u00e6morrhage was not accessible via surgical, endoscopic or endoluminal hemostasis.\n\nAs far as investigators know, there is no data in the literature to rely on when the major h\u00e6morrhage is not accessible via hemostatic intervention and the risk of thrombosis is high. When confronted with patients who need anticoagulation but have a high risk of h\u00e6morrhage recurrence, the question of when treatment should be resumed has not been resolved. This is why investigators propose to conduct a randomised comparative study to evaluate two treatment strategies - early resumption (H48 to H72) versus late resumption (H120 to H144) of anticoagulation.\n\nMAIN OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the present study is to evaluate in terms of bleeding risk, thrombosis risk and mortality at one month, the effect of early vs. late resumption of anticoagulation in patients having presented with serious h\u00e6morrhage while on curative-dose anticoagulants and facing a high thromboembolic risk."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Major h\u00e6morrhage"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["PHASE3"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "UFH Early group", "description": "Either curative dose, intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) so as to reach an anti-Xa activity between 0.3 and 0.7 IU/mL, lengthening the activated prothrombin time as determined by each centre according to the treatment area (depending on the coagulometer and reactants).\n\nOr low-molecular-weight, curative dose, subcutaneous heparin (LMWH) so as to reach an anti-Xa activity corresponding to treatment areas as determined for each type of molecule (about 0.5 to 1 anti-Xa IU for most LMWHs, administered via 2 daily injections, and about 0.5 to 1.5 anti-Xa IU for tinzaparin, 1 injection daily).", "armGroupLabels": ["UFH Early group"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "UFH Late group", "description": "Either curative dose, intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) so as to reach an anti-Xa activity between 0.3 and 0.7 IU/mL, lengthening the activated prothrombin time as determined by each centre according to the treatment area (depending on the coagulometer and reactants).\n\nOr low-molecular-weight, curative dose, subcutaneous heparin (LMWH) so as to reach an anti-Xa activity corresponding to treatment areas as determined for each type of molecule (about 0.5 to 1 anti-Xa IU for most LMWHs, administered via 2 daily injections, and about 0.5 to 1.5 anti-Xa IU for tinzaparin, 1 injection daily).", "armGroupLabels": ["UFH Late group"]}]}}}

The long-term goal is to develop a safe and effective treatment to prevent the severe gut disease called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).\n\nNEC is a common disease in neonatal intensive care units affecting 5-10% of all admitted patients. 15-30% of the affected children die from the disease, and many of the survivors suffer from the effects of extensive gut surgery.\n\nWhile the disease is caused by many different factors, recent research has shown the gut microbiome to be a central factor in the development of NEC. Furthermore, in the recent years special viruses called bacteriophages have shown potential in the treatment of various diseases.\n\nBy collecting feces from healthy, term infants and filtering it thoroughly, the investigators can provide a treatment that contains practically only viruses, proteins and nutrients.

Emotion recognition (ER) training provides a promising new avenue of research which may be beneficial in altering emotion processing biases which maintain or increase symptoms of mental health disorders. This study will examine the effectiveness of ER training in a community-based sample of young people (15-18 years) who report high levels of social anxiety. The intervention aims to alter emotion processing biases through a training procedure designed to promote the perception of happiness over disgust in ambiguous facial expressions which we hypothesise will subsequently reduce symptoms of social anxiety.\n\nThe study design consists of two phases. During Phase 1 participants will complete a screening questionnaire. This questionnaire will include a measure of the affective, cognitive, and behavioural components of social anxiety in adolescence. Depending on their suitability (i.e. scoring above a cut-off on a standardised measure of social anxiety in Phase 1 of the study), participants may then be invited to take part in a 4-day computer-based emotion recognition training programme (Phase 2). The purpose of this phase is to see if ER training will help young people feel less worried or nervous in social situations by training them to interpret ambiguous facial expressions as expressing a positive emotion (happy rather than disgusted).\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or placebo (inactive) group. Both groups will be asked to complete a 4-day programme involving one computer training session per day (each session takes approximately 20 minutes). Questionnaires will also be given to participants to complete before and after the intervention, along with a 2-week follow-up assessment. These will include questionnaires to measure social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and fear of negative evaluation. Each questionnaire will take approximately 15 minutes to complete.

It is the most common benign tumor in men, generally affecting those over 40 years old. The risk of BPH is more than 50% in men aged 50 to 60 and rises to 90% in men by age 80.\n\nThis hyperplasia leads to altered urinary flow and bladder outlet obstruction, referred to as \"lower urinary tract symptoms\" or LUTS, which become more frequent with age. These symptoms are categorized as obstructive or irritative. In the early stages, men with BPH may have difficulty starting urination and may feel as if their bladder is not completely empty. As a result, they need to urinate more often, especially at night, a condition known as nocturia. Additionally, the volume and velocity of the urinary flow may decrease significantly, as evidenced by flow measurements, and residual urine discharge may occur at the end of urination.\n\nHigh-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a medical technique that uses high-intensity ultrasonic waves to treat various medical conditions, including malignant and benign tumors, without the need for invasive surgery or ionizing radiation. HIFU generates heat between 80\u00b0 to 95\u00b0C at the focal point, causing necrosis of the targeted area with pinpoint accuracy. In urology, HIFU is used to treat prostate cancer in a minimally invasive manner, with focused ultrasounds delivered endorectally using a transducer that targets the treatment area with real-time monitoring.\n\nExclusively targeted HIFU treatment has been suggested for BPH, where localized necrosis of the side lobes reduces the volume of the prostatic transition zone, alleviating compression of the prostatic urethra and improving urinary symptoms.\n\nThis new study was initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HIFU for BPH treatment."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "HIFU", "description": "high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia", "armGroupLabels": ["HIFU"]}]}}}

Traditional diagnostic methods are invasive and carry risks. This study proposes a non-invasive, innovative approach utilizing galactomannan (GM) analysis in Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC) for early IPA detection.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of measuring GM levels in EBC for detecting IPA in mechanically ventilated patients, comparing it against the conventional Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF)-GM measurements.\n\nMethods: A clinical trial will be conducted with 75 mechanically ventilated patients suspected of having IPA. The study will compare the effectiveness of EBC-GM levels against BALF-GM levels in diagnosing IPA, focusing on sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy. The novel, self-designed EBC collection device will facilitate the safe and efficient collection of EBC from patients.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n\nValidation of EBC-GM Diagnostic Accuracy: Anticipate demonstrating that EBC-GM levels provide a comparable diagnostic accuracy to BALF-GM, establishing a non-invasive, safer alternative for IPA detection.\n\nImplementation of a Non-Invasive Diagnostic Tool: The study aims to introduce a non-invasive diagnostic approach that can potentially replace more risky, invasive methods, improving patient care in ICUs.\n\nContribution to Clinical Practice: By providing a new method for early and safer detection of IPA, the study is expected to influence clinical guidelines and practices in the management of critically ill, ventilated patients.\n\nSignificance: This research has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis of fungal infections in critically ill patients by offering a non-invasive, accurate, and safer diagnostic tool, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing the risks associated with invasive diagnostic procedures."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Critical Illness", "Respiration Failure", "Respiratory Fungal Infection", "Exhaled Breath Condensate", "Aspergillosis, Invasive Pulmonary"]}, "designModule": {}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Compare the levels of Galactomannan (GM) levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and BALF", "description": "Investigators tested EBC-GM levels and BALF-GM levels in patients with confirmed IPA to compare the diagnostic value of EBC-GM versus BALF-GM.", "armGroupLabels": ["IPA group", "control group"]}]}}}

The two most common causes are atherosclerosis (30 to 35%) and cardio-embolic origin (35 to 40%).

Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation appears to cause a significant proportion of these cryptogenic cerebral infarctions. One of the major challenges in the management of cerebral infarctions is the prevention of recurrence. If the cause is atheromatous, treatment is based on platelet antiaggregants and the correction of cardiovascular risk factors. If the cause is atrial fibrillation, the treatment of choice is anticoagulation therapy. Cryptogenic strokes are managed with antiplatelet therapy. In past studies, the thrombi responsible for cerebral infarctions have been analyzed anatomopathologically to see if the composition of the thrombi could help identify the cause of the cerebral infarction. These studies have proved to be contradictory. The composition of the bacterial flora of cerebral infarct thrombi has not yet been studied, apart from some limited data on septic emboli. In myocardial infarction, the cause of which is almost exclusively atheromatous, bacteria of the periodontal flora have been detected in thrombi of ST-segment elevation infarctions. The causes of cerebral infarction are multiple. The hypotheses explored in this study are that there are differences in the composition of the bacterial flora of the thrombus depending on whether the cause is atheromatous or cardio-embolic and that the study of the composition of the thrombus could be used to identify the cardio-embolic cause in patients with cryptogenic cerebral infarction."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Patient With Symptomatic Cerebral Infarction", "Patient Who Has Had a Mechanical Thrombectomy"]}, "designModule": {}}}

Despite advances in pharmacologic therapy, morbidity , mortality and rates of hospitalization for stroke remain high. These data emphasize the importance of identifying all treatable conditions that could aggravate stroke. One such condition is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).\n\nSleep-related breathing disorders, including obstructive and central sleep apnea, often coexist with stroke. Compared to the general population, in whom OSA is the most common form of this breathing disorder with recent prevalence estimates of 22% of male and 17% of female , in the stroke population, the prevalence of OSA is much greater at 70% . Several randomized controlledtrials on OSA patients with stroke in acute or sub-acute stage showed that treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improved motor and functional outcomes, accelerated neurological recovery.Apart from the benefits in better neurological outcomes, secondary analyses of SAVE study suggested that CPAP treatment potentially help to reduce recurrence of stroke. Nevertheless, we don't have evidence yet from randomized control studies to prove CPAP treatment would reduce the recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.\n\nTraditionally, recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events uses documented mortality, morbidity or hospitalization for heart failure, acute coronary syndrome or stroke as clinical endpoints. Recently, several studies showed that enlarged left atrium (LA) can serve as a predictor for recurrent stroke or cardiovascular events. On the other hand, a growing body of studies demonstrated that CPAP treatment reduce size of LA in those with OSA. Notably, all of these studies above are observational or retrospective in nature. To date, there are no prospective longitudinal randomized controlled trials reporting the effect of CPAP treatment of OSA on the change of size of LA.

PD affects a person's movement speed, fluency, quality, and ease of walking. PD has the fastest-growing incidence rate, with its prevalence expected to double over the next three decades, currently affecting 10 million people worldwide. PD often leads to disturbances in walking/gait characteristics such as abnormal/variable stride lengths and step times. Those disturbances increase the risk of falls, with about 39% of people with PD (PwPD) experiencing an average of 20.8 falls/year.\n\nResearch has examined cueing by leveraging auditory, visual, and tactile cues to normalize variable gait characteristics and improve mobility to reduce falls. Auditory cueing is the most effective at improving gait and most practical to apply in all settings (via headphones) but one size does not fit all when using auditory cueing paradigms i.e., there is a need for personalised approaches to ensure cueing interventions are tailored to the individual and their specific functional limitations. Furthermore, the long-term effectiveness of auditory mechanisms (e.g., metronome-based repetitive beep) suffer from their lack of continuous engagement.\n\nThis research project aims to examine personalised auditory cueing to improve gait in PwPD.

As the disease progresses, pancreatic tissue is damaged, resulting in impaired endocrine and exocrine functions, manifesting as symptoms like steatorrhea and diabetes. Pain associated with chronic pancreatitis (PACP) is the most common symptom in CP patients. Approximately 75% of patients initially present with abdominal pain, and previous studies have shown that PACP can occur in 85-97% of CP patients. However, there is a type of pancreatitis where patients do not experience abdominal pain and typically seek medical attention due to routine check-ups or symptoms of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine dysfunction; this particular type of pancreatitis is known as painless CP. A meta-analysis showed that painless CP accounts for about 12% of all CP patients.\n\nIn patients with CP, continuous pancreatic damage leads to the destruction of pancreatic tissue, subsequently causing insufficiency in both exocrine and endocrine functions. \"Painless\" does not equate to \"harmless\"; patients with painless CP often present with severe symptoms of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine dysfunction at the time of diagnosis. These findings underscore the importance of early identification and active management of patients with painless CP.\n\nWhether active endoscopic intervention is needed for painless CP remains a matter of debate. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) suggests endoscopic therapy and/or extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) as the first-line therapy for painful uncomplicated chronic pancreatitis (CP) with an obstructed main pancreatic duct (MPD) in the head/ body of the pancreas; however, due to the unclear potential benefits (preservation of pancreatic function) of endoscopic and/or ESWL treatment for painless CP, it is not recommended for patients without pain, although the evidence is of low quality.\n\nAlthough there is currently no consensus on whether endoscopic treatment can protect the pancreatic function of patients with painless chronic pancreatitis, preliminary evidence suggests that endoscopic treatment may have a positive impact on pancreatic atrophy and dysfunction in patients with painless CP. In a retrospective study by Ikeura et al., which included 268 patients with CP and painless pancreatic duct stones, it was found that endoscopic treatment and complete clearance of stones in patients with painless pancreatic duct stones helped maintain the volume of the pancreatic parenchyma.\n\nAlthough preliminary research suggests that endoscopic treatment may protect pancreatic function in patients with painless CP, it could also trigger pain. A study by Ikeura et al. found that painless CP patients who underwent endoscopic treatment but did not have complete clearance of pancreatic duct stones were at a significantly higher risk of developing pain. This indicates that incomplete endoscopic treatment might lead patients from a painless state to one of pain. However, a study by Amodio et al. suggests that the likelihood of painless CP patients experiencing pain in the short term is low, implying that conservative treatment might be more appropriate.\n\nCurrent research on the clinical characteristics of painless CP and its response to treatment is relatively limited, necessitating further clinical studies to clarify the impact of ERCP and/or ESWL on these patients. We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess whether these minimally invasive interventions can improve clinical outcomes for patients with painless CP"}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Painless Chronic Pancreatitis"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Lifestyle modifications", "description": "Lifestyle modifications primarily include quitting smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as engaging in physical exercise.", "armGroupLabels": ["Conservative Treatment Group", "Endotherapy and/or Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy Group"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Pancreatic enzyme (Pancreatin Enteric-coated Capsules or Oryz-Aspergillus Enzyme and Pancreatin Table), antidiabetic medicine(Acarbose , Metformin, Glimepirde Tablets, Insulin)", "description": "This intervention involves the use of medications to control the pancreatic exocrine and endocrine dysfunction caused by chronic pancreatitis.\n\n1.

The EICAR trial demonstrated that injection with high flow rates of prewarmed contrast media (CM) was safe and patients did not experience any pain, stress of discomfort during injection. Flow rates as high as 8.8 ml/s were injected without any discomfort. All concentrations used (e.g. 240, 300 and 370 mg I/ml) in this study were prewarmed. According to the recent recommendations (ESUR guidelines 10.0) it should be considered to warm iodine-based CM before administration. The hypothesis is that although using CM at room temperature (\\~23\u00b0C \\[\\~73\u00b0F\\]) might result in lower attenuation of the liver parenchyma than would be achieved using CM pre-warmed to body temperature, diagnostic image quality, patient safety and comfort will not be compromised by not pre-warming CM in this setting. According to the guidelines, it is regarded as best clinical practice to pre-warm CM. Surprisingly, these recommendations are merely based on a hypothetical assumption. In the literature, there are no studies evaluating this topic and it has never been clearly shown to result in a better patient comfort. For this reason, many clinics do not pre-warm their CM in daily clinical routine. Only one study evaluated subjective comfort in hysterosalpingography (HSG), in which CM is injected in to the cavity of the uterus.

However, recent studies have suggested that some of these microemboli could be responsible for acute brain injury, as documented by DW MRI.\n\nIndeed the high sensitivity of DW MRI suggests that this technique could allow an improved estimate of cerebral ischemic events associated with cardiovascular-catheter procedures. We therefore decided to perform DW MRI before and after cardiac catheterization to prospectively assess both clinically silent and apparent cerebral embolisms for the first time in a multicenter trial.

Some patients experience more severe reactions such as dry and/or moist desquamation but most patients experience mild reactions e.g. erythema (Lopez et al., 2005). The radiation dose, volume, RT technique and previous treatment, such as type of surgery and previous chemotherapy, are factors that might impact on the risk for ARSR together with patient-related factors such as body mass index (BMI), smoking status and previous skin damage (Porock et al., 1998; Wells et al., 2004). In a pilot study (n=93) of the frequency of ARSR in patients with breast cancer who underwent adjuvant RT it was shown that 93% developed ARSR, mostly mild reactions. Patients reported low scores on pain and itching (Sharp et al., 2011). Over 80% of the patients reported adherence to the skin care recommendations which included application of a thin layer of Essex\u00ae cream, a non-perfumed aqueous cream, on the irradiated area at least two times a day (Sharp et al., 2011). The effects of skin care products containing Calendula Officinalis (marigold plant) on ARSR in patients with breast cancer were investigated in a randomized clinical trial (Pommier et al., 2004). Patients in the experimental group, treated with calendula cream had a statistically significant lower incidence of severe ARSR, pain and treatment interruptions in comparison with the patients in the control group, treated with trolamine.\n\nThe purpose of this blinded, randomized clinical trial is to compare two topical agents, Calendula Weleda\u00ae cream and Essex\u00ae cream, in terms of efficacy to reduce the risk of severe acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR) in relation to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for breast cancer.\n\nPatients were instructed to apply a thin layer of the assigned cream twice a day, starting at the onset of RT and continue until two weeks after termination, or until the ARSR is healed. The application should include the whole treatment area including the armpit and shoulder/back area in patients treated with modified radical mastectomy. Patients are also advised to not apply the cream within two hours before the RT in order to avoid possible build-up effect. Daily wash with perfume free soap and tap water are recommended and patients are advised to refrain from use of other topical agents in the irradiated area.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the efficacy to reduce acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR), assessed with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/The Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (RTOG/EORTC scale) at follow-up.\n\nSecondary endpoints include patient reported outcome measures; Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), Sleep disturbances (MOS-sleep questionnaire) and symptoms experienced from the irradiated area (visual analogue scale). Patients' experiences and adherence to the topical agents are also evaluated.\n\nA total of 400 patients are required to detect a true absolute reduction in the proportion of patients with ARSR, from 35% with standard treatment (Essex\u00ae cream) to 20% with the experimental treatment (Calendula Weleda\u00ae cream), with a significance level of 5% a power of 90%.

This can be done by having you take the drug, ALA, before your surgery. ALA is a molecule that already exists in the cells of your body. Once enough of it is in your body, it gets converted into another molecule named PpIX. If blue light is shined on a tumor that has enough PpIX, it will glow with red light (fluorescence) that can be detected with a special camera. In this study, we want to determine how the fluorescence (red light) is related to the tumor which appears in the images that are normally taken of your brain (which the surgeon uses to guide the removal of your tumor) and the tumor tissue that will be removed during your surgery.

Non-specific low back pain is the main cause of public spending on health care and labor concepts, with a prevalence of 80%. Furthermore, this pathology represents more than half (52.92%) of the diagnoses of chronic pain that is neither oncologic nor neuropathic. This situation generates high economic, health care and labor costs, representing an equivalent cost of between 1.7% and 2.1% of the Gross Domestic Product.\n\nLow back pain is described as pain located between the lower limit of the ribs and the lower limit of the buttocks, the intensity of which varies according to posture and physical activity, and which is usually accompanied by painful limitation of movement. Approximately 40% of patients with low back pain present irradiation in the lower extremity. The chronification of low back pain can result in central sensitization, causing hypersensitivity to non-painful and painful stimuli even long after the onset of the acute episode of low back pain.\n\nThe approach to low back pain offers options such as the administration of drugs, prescription of physical exercise, pain education and modification of patients' habits. Minimally invasive techniques in the management of low back pain are arousing greater interest due to their great advantages. In the field of physical therapy, novel techniques have been developed in recent years, such as ultrasound-guided percutaneous musculoskeletal electrolysis and ultrasound-guided percutaneous neuromodulation, in which different types of electric current are applied through solid needles. Different mechanisms of action have been associated with these invasive techniques, such as a potential effect on the activation of descending pain inhibitory system pathways, the reduction of evoked motor potentials and an increase in intracortical inhibition, suggesting benefits in patients with central sensitization. The invasive techniques of electrolysis and neuromodulation have been applied in other studies at the nervous level, especially in the sciatic nerve at the piriformis and ischiotibial level, in the popliteal fossa and in the foot. It has given good results in lumbar pain. However, there is no study carried out in patients with low back pain and the presence of hernias or protrusions, nor is there any control of the evolution in the medium and long term.\n\nThe application of percutaneous neuromodulation has the capacity to modulate neuronal activity in the primary motor cortex, promoting transient and long-term neuroplastic effects. The modulation of this region is related to a decrease in pain due to the relationship with pain processing areas, such as the thalamus, cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray matter. Electrical stimulation of the peripheral nervous system percutaneously activates a complex neural network that in turn involves a series of neurotransmitters and receptors, such mechanisms being able to promote segmental analgesia and extra-segmental analgesia. Some studies suggest that percutaneous neuromodulation therapy may have a possible beneficial effect in patients with central sensitization, producing improved conditioned pain modulation, reduced motor evoked potential and enhanced intracortical inhibition.\n\nTo the authors' knowledge, there are no studies that prove the effectiveness of these invasive techniques in the improvement of neurophysiological parameters in patients with low back pain with irradiation in the lower extremity, presence of hernias and/or protrusions. Taking into account the good empirical results found in private clinics and the precedents of other studies carried out with short-term follow-up in other regions, this treatment approach of outpatient application in primary care centers could mean a discharge of patients who are referred to the hospital for medical care, imaging tests and surgical interventions."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Low Back Pain"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Invasive Physiotherapy Group", "description": "The study participants corresponding to the intervention group will receive the treatment proposed by their medical doctor.

Clinical research with LSD ended in the 1970s due to regulatory restrictions but its use for personal and recreational purposes continued. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the use hallucinogens in psychiatric research and practices. LSD and psilocybin were reused in experimental studies in healthy subjects and in the treatment for anxiety in patients with life-threatening diseases. Specifically, a pilot study documented that LSD can be used safely and may reduce anxiety in these patients. Larger well-designed and placebo-controlled studies are warranted. Similar studies have recently been completed with the hallucinogen psilocybin.\n\nObjective: To test the efficacy of LSD in patients with anxiety with or without life-threatening diseases.\n\nDesign: Double-blind, placebo-controlled random-order cross-over trial using two LSD (200 \u00b5g) and two placebo sessions with subjects acting as their own control.\n\nParticipants: 40 patients aged \\> 25 years with anxiety disorder (according to DSM-IV or a state-trait anxiety inventory score \\>40 in the STAI trait or state scale) with or without life-threatening illness.\n\nMain outcome measures: Reduction in anxiety (STAI), depression (Hamilton depression rating scale, HDRS and Beck depression inventory, BDI), and general psychopathological symptoms (Symptom Check List 90 items, SCL-90) at 2, 8, and 16 weeks after LSD- compared with placebo-assisted psychotherapy.\n\nSignificance: Anxiety disorder (alone or in the context of life-threatening illness) is frequent and often insufficiently managed with available medications.

Participants complete a paper questionnaire in the waiting room of one of the clinics. Participants from the second university outpatient clinic and a family mental health clinic complete a digital version. At baseline, participants are presented with the CORE-OM and the Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45). At each follow-up point, they are presented with the CORE-OM plus mental health service evaluation items.\n\nIn the student and community samples, data is collected at two time points (i.e. baseline and retest). At baseline, participants are presented with the CORE-OM and OQ-45. After two weeks (i.e. retest) participants are contacted via email and presented with the CORE-OM.\n\nThe application modality in the non-clinical samples is mixed: students and general community participants complete paper or digital versions of the questionnaire in the classroom or community, respectively. The digital version of the questionnaire can be accessed by clicking a Uniform Resource Locator embedded in an email/message, or by scanning a Quick Response (QR) code with a smartphone.\n\nRECRUITMENT: The clinical sample is recruited at two university outpatient clinics and a family mental health clinic of Santiago, Chile which provide services to patients of low to medium income. Patients in one of the university clinics are approached in the waiting area, and those meeting inclusion criteria, and willing to participate, fill out an informed consent before responding the questionnaire.

Based on our review of the pertinent literature, there is substantial evidence suggesting that prolonged exposure to oxygen during storage results in oxidative damage to the red blood cells leading to decreased therapeutic potential. Therefore, removal of oxygen from red blood cell products prior to storage has potential to preserve the cells in a more physiologically relevant state.\n\nCurrently, Hemanext has focused on the design and development of a dual compartment bag system designated as the Hemanext Red Blood Cell Processing System. After standard processing of donated whole blood units into leukoreduced packed red blood cells (LR-RBCs) with the appropriate additive solutions, the LR-RBCs would then be placed in the oxygen reduction bag (ORB) which allows for the rapid diffusion of oxygen out of the blood, through a sterile, oxygen-permeable membrane, and into iron-based oxygen sorbents. After processing, the blood is transferred again from the ORB into the Hemanext storage bag (HSB) which will preserve the anaerobic state of the LR-RBC product for the duration of cold storage.\n\nHemanext has conducted preliminary storage tests to ascertain the effects of anaerobic storage on overall blood health in various storage solutions. The research team has focused primarily on percent hemolysis, which is mandated by the FDA to remain below 1% for the duration of storage, as well as ATP and 2,3-DPG levels."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Whole Blood Donation and Leukoreduction"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["PHASE2"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Hemanext Red Blood Cell Processing System", "description": "Leukoreduced red blood cell product from donors in the Investigational Product arm will be processed in the Hemanext Oxygen Reduction Bag for 3 hours and then transferred to the Hemanext Storage Bag and stored for 42 days at 1-6\u00b0C.", "armGroupLabels": ["Investigational Product"]}]}}}

HBL may be attributed to inherited disorders caused by mutations in several known genes. Intestinal recessive HBL includes abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) (OMIM 200100) and Chylomicron Retention Disease (CMRD) (OMIM 246700) - also called Anderson's disease. Those two recessives form of HBL are the ones considered in this study. ABL is due to mutations in the Microsomal Triglyceride Transfer Protein (MTTP) gene which is required for the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins: Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and chylomicrons (CM) in both liver and intestine. Similarly, CMRD is due to mutations in the Sar1b gene encoding the Sar1b protein involved in the control of the intracellular trafficking of CMs in COPII-coated vesicles. Due to a defect in Apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins these diseases are characterized by dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) malabsorption inducing digestive and growth disorders from birth. In parallel, neurological manifestations may appear, mainly as a consequence of vitamin E and A deficiencies.\n\nOphthalmological disorders are inconstant, with many patients being asymptomatic until adulthood. Loss of night or color vision are the first symptoms associated with retinal degeneration. Without treatment with high doses of vitamins, retinal degeneration can lead to blindness. The exact biological mechanism still remains unknown. Indeed, cases described in the scientific literature demonstrate that early treatment with high doses of vitamin E and A can stop or prevent neurological complications in the vast majority of patients; however, ophthalmic complications have a more versatile response.\n\nThus, despite early vitamin supplementation, several cases of adolescent or adult patients with vision impairment in the form of retinitis pigmentosa have been reported. This so-called secondary retinitis pigmentosa is characterized by a progressive loss of photoreceptors and a dysfunction of the pigmentary epithelium resulting in a progressive and gradual loss of vision, usually leading to blindness. Interestingly, primary (i.e., genetic) retinitis pigmentosa are characterized by \"macula lutea\" atrophy composed of two lipophilic molecules from the carotenoid xanthophyll family lutein and zeaxanthin, also known as macular pigments. Moreover, preliminary data seem to show that the patients considered for this study, present decreased plasmatic carotene concentrations as well as plasmatic vitamin E concentrations largely lower than the threshold of normality.\n\nThus, even if early treatment seems to prevent major ophthalmic complications, it does not provide total ophthalmic protection, which suggests the involvement of other factors among which carotenoids could occupy a prominent place given their essential role in maintaining the integrity of the macula."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Primary Intestinal Hypocholesterolemia", "Abetalipoproteinemia", "Chylomicron Retention Disease"]}, "designModule": {}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "BIOLOGICAL", "name": "Characterization of carotenoid status and plasma levels of oxidative stress markers in patients (case group only)", "description": "Carotenoid status will be determined by measuring plasma and erythrocyte concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin obtained during an annual blood draw.

Active cigarette smoking has other detrimental effects on asthma morbidity including more severe symptoms, increased rates of hospitalisation, and accelerated decline in lung function. Smoking cessation advice is often ineffective because many adult smokers with asthma do not believe that they are personally at risk from their smoking, take many years until stopping smoking and frequently restart smoking after quitting.

Low back pain prevalence is shown to be 84% while 23% of chronic low back pain. Disability due to low back pain is about 11 to 12%. Low back pain is a leading cause of increasing economic burden in respect to huge medical expenses. Statistical analysis of indirect and direct expenses for the low back pain treatment in U.S shows over $100 billion per year.Many risk factors for low back pain has been identified including degeneration of lumbar discs, over weight/obesity, sedentary life style and mechanical factors i.e. occupational sitting, manual handling and assisting patients, awkward postures, lifting and carrying weights. Exercise therapy is suggested as an effective treatment in improving function of the back muscles and relieving pain in patients with Low back pain. Many studies suggested that muscle vibration is effective as the vibration signals are delivered via an external stimulator that is exposed to the part of the body resulting in pain relief and reducing muscle spasm. Vibratory stimuli have practical uses in rehabilitation and in exercise performance. Increasing reflexive activity through the stimulation of muscle spindles results in tonic vibratory reflex. The mechanical and electrical responses of the muscle could vary with the frequency of the vibration to the muscle. LMV effects are localized to the point where the stimulation is given and this is the result of neurogenic potentiation through the tonic vibratory reflex from the stimulation of muscle spindles.

In addition to studying safety, Phase II clinical trials test if the investigational drug is effective and whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved CRLX101 for your type of cancer.\n\nCamptothecin is a chemical extracted from plants that is the basis for the standard FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs irinotecan and topotecan. Camptothecin works by interfering with the way cells divide and multiply. The investigational drug CRLX101 is a formulation of camptothecin and a large molecule (nanoparticle)that appears to allow more of the camptothecin to get into tumors and stay in tumors. The persistence of the CRLX101 in the tumor may increase the probability that the tumor cells will be damaged.\n\nCRLX101 has been well tolerated in the laboratory and in participants with different kinds of cancer.\n\nBevacizumab (Avastin) is a VEGF inhibitor which has activity in many kinds of cancer. Bevacizumab has been successfully combined with many chemotherapy partners.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that the combination of bevacizumab with CRLX101 might have unique clinical activity in combination in the treatment of this disease due to the simultaneous inhibition of distinct steps along the HIF \u2192 (CAIX) \u2192 VEGF \u2192 VEGFR2 pathway.

It is a multi-dimensional disease that is associated with symptoms that have been characterized as positive, negative, and cognitive. CDS is a core feature of schizophrenia, and most individuals with schizophrenia exhibit cognitive impairment. Attention disorders, slow information processing, working memory disorders, and lack of flexibility for adaptive strategies are symptoms of cognitive impairment that have a devastating impact on the function, employment, and social status of patients with schizophrenia.\n\nOlder typical neuroleptic medications (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine) do not improve cognition. In fact, haloperidol has been shown to induce cognitive impairment in schizophrenic patients.\n\nNovel atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, clozapine, and olanzapine, seem to produce gains in cognition. This improvement may reflect a diminution of extrapyramidal side effects of the typical high potency neuroleptics. Alternatively, it might reflect more effective symptom reduction by the novel antipsychotics, or direct cognitive enhancement through the effects of the newer agents on a variety of neurotransmitters, their receptors, and gene expression. Even when the newer antipsychotic medications improve cognition, they do not normalize it.\n\nPresently, there are no approved therapies for CDS. However, in schizophrenic patients, nicotine improves multiple cognitive domains, including working memory and attention. Furthermore, based on a strong body of evidence ranging from genetic mapping to clinical trials, the alpha7 NNR subtype has emerged as a primary therapeutic target relevant to CDS and other core symptoms of schizophrenia"}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Cognitive Dysfunction", "Schizophrenia"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["PHASE2"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "TC-5619", "description": "TC-5619-238 will be provided as hard gelatin capsules in strengths of 1mg, 5mg, and 25mg.", "armGroupLabels": ["TC-5619"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo", "description": "Placebo will be provided with exactly the same shape, size and appearance.", "armGroupLabels": ["Placebo"]}]}}}

Data from the National Registry of Disease in Singapore shows a 9.4% rise in HF admissions in public hospitals from 2008 to 2009 (4140 to 4530). Anaemia (low blood Haemoglobin level) is a common problem occurring in HF, ranging from 14% to 56% in outpatient registries and clinical trials. Anaemia exacerbates the basic symptoms of HF of dyspnea and exercise intolerance, thereby reducing quality of life (QoL). However, recent approaches aimed at improving and normalizing Haemoglobin have been unsuccessful.Novel approaches are required to address this problem. Iron deficiency (ID) is a well-understood cause of anaemia. ID without overt anaemia may be present in HF patients. A recent study by Jankowska et al published in 2010 of 546 HF patients showed a 37% prevalence of ID, regardless of Haemoglobin level. This was associated with worse outcomes including impaired exercise capacity. The presence of ID indicates a higher likelihood of deteriorating and dying early. A landmark study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (The Ferinject Assessment in Patients with Iron Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure (FAIR-HF) study) showed that HF patients who were treated with IV iron in the form of Ferric Carboxymaltose (FCM) had better outcomes, including improved exercise capacity, overall function, and quality of life.\n\nThere is a lack of contemporary data on ID in HF patients in Asia, including data on treatment with this novel IV iron FCM.\n\nHypothesis We hypothesise that treating ID in HF patients in Asia using FCM will improve outcomes including exercise capacity, quality of life, overall functional status, and the need to be hospitalised for complications arising from HF."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Heart Failure", "Anemia", "Iron Deficiency"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["PHASE4"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Ferric Carboxymaltose", "description": "1000mg intravenous Ferric Carboxymaltose, given as undiluted slow bolus injection over 15 minutes.

If cancer recurs after surgical removal of the prostate, targeted PSMA PET (positron emission tomography) can detect metastases even at very low PSA (prostate-specific Antigen) values. This increasingly allows individualized specific therapy of patients with prostate cancer recurrence. PSMA PET has now been included in national and international guidelines for the diagnosis of patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.\n\nEspecially in patients in good general condition, with potentially longer life expectancy and early localized PSA recurrence, advances in molecular imaging are increasingly turning local therapy concepts into focus. Here both, radiotherapeutic (salvage radiotherapy of the lymphatic drainage) and surgical interventions (salvage lymph node dissection = removal of the pelvic lymph nodes) are offered on an individual basis.\n\nThese regional therapies mainly aim to achieve a delay of further progression of the prostate cancer disease, and thus delay the initiation of palliative, sustained drug therapy. Previous standard or common practice at salvage lymph node dissection is the removal on both sides of the pelvic lymph nodes even if only one-sided suspicious lymph nodes are detected on imaging. Although the complications of salvage lymph node dissection are usually minor and manageable, they can still lead to impaired lymphatic drainage, leg edema, lymphocele formation or other surgical complications.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to investigate whether a unilateral pelvic lymph node dissection on the side of conspicuous PSMA PET is sufficient and a dissection on the contralateral side can be dispensed without negatively impacting oncological outcomes and thereby sparing the patient the potential additional complications of a bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Prostate Cancer"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "PROCEDURE", "name": "Salvage Lymphnode dissection", "description": "A salvage lymphnode dissection is performed in all study patients (both arms)using standard surgical techniques (openly or DaVinci).In patients who were randomized to the bilateral pelvic lymphnode dissection group, a salvage lymphadenectomy was also performed on the opposite side with resection of the corresponding fields that were removed on the PSMA-PET positive side (th \"Blinding\" must be guaranteed during pathological assessment)", "armGroupLabels": ["Unilateral lymphnode dissection", "bilateral Lymphnode dissection"]}]}}}

While these problems are multifaceted, studies outside the VHA have shown that using \"consumer providers\" (CPs) can improve and augment public care. Similar to recovering addiction counselors, CPs are individuals with SMI who use their lived experiences to provide services to others with SMI. CPs can reach out to patients that are difficult to engage, assist patients with tasks of daily living, offer a variety of rehabilitation (vocational, social, residential) services, be role models and offer hope for recovery, and facilitate support groups. Randomized controlled and quasi-experimental trials, all done outside the VHA, have shown that CPs can provide services that yield at least equivalent patient outcomes with particular benefits noted on intensive case management teams. Based on these successes both the President's New Freedom Commission and the Veteran Administration's Mental Health Strategic Plan call for broader dissemination of CPs as way to make mental health services more recovery-oriented, a recent national priority. Because of these recent calls, employing mentally ill veterans has just begun, although no effort has been made to evaluate their impact inside the VA mental health system.

However, because the gastrointestinal tract is in the abdominal cavity and the clinic lacks perfusion direct monitoring means, at present, gastrointestinal function indicators are mostly used to guide the clinic, and the treatment is often blind and lagging. Gastrointestinal perfusion Research on gastrointestinal perfusion is mostly confined to abdominal perfusion pressure (mean arterial pressure - intra-abdominal pressure).

The investigators may not be able to ensure adequate blood flow to the digestive organs by relying on intra-abdominal perfusion pressure alone. Direct organ flow monitoring is a more accurate means of organization.\n\nThe superior mesenteric artery (SMA) supplies all of the intestinal tract (small bowel, part of the colon) and is a long vessel that can to reflect the perfusion status of the distal overall bowel. Color Doppler ultrasonography is used to evaluate intestinal vessels such as the SMA in healthy and outpatient patients.\n\nThe use of color Doppler ultrasonography to assess blood flow in intestinal vessels such as the SMA in healthy and outpatient patients has been in use since the 1980s.

Right heart dysfuction, right atrial hypertension, and abdominal hypertension can cause obstruction of portal venous return, which can lead to edema and dysfunction of the bowel. This can lead to edema of the intestinal tract and dysfunction. Therefore, monitoring the venous return status of portal vein, hepatic vein and inferior vena cava is also important for the perfusion of the intestine.\n\nTherefore, monitoring the status of venous return in the portal vein, hepatic vein, inferior vena cava, etc. is also important for intestinal perfusion.\n\nDoppler ultrasound technology has been widely used in the field of cardiac critical care and craniocerebral critical care, but it is still in the exploratory stage in the field of critical care digestion, and this study is an innovative and exploratory one."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Critically Ill Patients"]}, "designModule": {}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "Acute gastrointestinal injury", "description": "AGIUS score\\>2", "armGroupLabels": ["AGI group"]}]}}}

Late complications can be postponed or avoided when assuring a good diabetes control, i.e. sensible diet, exercise, frequent blood glucose measurements and a good medical treatment.\n\nBlood glucose regulation depends on two different factors i.e. the insulin need of the body and the amount of insulin in the body. The amount of insulin, in blood, is decided by the amount of insulin infused daily, whereas the insulin need depends on the patient's weight, physical activity and diet. Overweight type 2 diabetes patients have a large insulin need and especially this need is decisive for their development of diabetes. If these patients are treated with Metformin, blood glucose decreases and the result is an easier weight loss for the patient. Especially, when these patients take this drug, the development of late diabetic complications, especially arteriosclerosis, can be avoided or postponed.\n\nWhether these favourable effects of Metformin are also present in type 1 diabetic patients remains to be fully clarified, but some studies have indicated that this is the case. This results in a better regulation of diabetes on a smaller insulin dose than the one given to the patients before.\n\nMetformin probably takes effect by increasing the glucose uptake in muscles and by reducing the hepatic glucose production. The drug usually has no side-effects, but some patients do, however, suffer from abdominal pain, small tendency to nausea, loose defaecation and a metallic taste in the mouth. These side-effects are often temporary.\n\nProject description\n\nIn total, 50 type 1 diabetic patients are offered to participate in the project. All are from the outpatient clinic at the Department of Endocrinology. The project lasts 7 months divided as follows:\n\n1. An introductory period of one month introducing an optimisation of the insulin treatment\n2. A 6 month period (in which neither the patients nor the treating doctor know which medication is given) with either T. Metformin treatment twice daily or T. Placebo (lime) twice daily together with the usual insulin treatment four times daily.\n\nChoice of either T. Metformin or T. Placebo will be made by draw, and as stated above, the drug type will be unknown for both the patient and the treating doctor in order to make sure that the investigation is as objective as possible.\n\nThroughout the examination period, the patients are asked to measure blood glucose four times daily, i.e. before main meals and before bed time. These values will be used for regulating the fasting insulin dose with help from the treating doctor, and for adjusting the daily insulin dose. During the first and the last two days of the examination period we will also ask the patients to measure blood glucose at 03h00 for two days. Those diurnal profiles will be included in the evaluation of the blood glucose control during the treatment period. Furthermore, the patients' blood pressures are determined during 24 hours before and after the 6 months' treatment period. This will be carried out automatically by means of a blood pressure cuff around the arm connected to a small apparatus registering the values during 24 hours. The apparatus can be taken home after installation at the outpatient clinic and can be carried around in a belt around the waist until next day where the apparatus will be dismantled.\n\nAt the first and the last of 5 outpatient visits, blood tests will be taken (for evaluation of the long-term blood glucose, kidney, liver, insulin and fat in blood) and nocturnal urine must be collected and disposed in order to evaluate protein secretion and thereby kidney function."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["PHASE4"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Tablet Metformin 500 mg", "armGroupLabels": ["Metformin"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Placebo", "armGroupLabels": ["Placebo comparator"]}]}}}

Physical and social isolation, home isolation, and quarantine policies applied during epidemic periods such as SARS, MERS, Ebola have been associated with lifestyle changes (Lippi, 2019). Much of the research on the health impact of epidemics and isolation has focused on psychological issues such as stress-related symptoms and disorders and to a lesser extent social support and stress management. In contrast, the epidemic and its associated lifestyle issues during quarantine and isolation, including the impact of dietary changes, restricted physical activity, and increased indoor and screen time, are still not investigated. A limited number of studies have examined lifestyle changes during COVID-19 and previous epidemic periods. However, there is no Turkish survey that comprehensively deals with the lifestyle, the scope of which is expanding, today. The Brief Multidimensional Lifestyle Assessment Scale, which we planned to validate in our study, is a scale developed by Balanz\u00e1-Mart\u00ednez et al to multi-dimensionally evaluate the lifestyle changes that occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak. It consists of 7 parts (Diet and Nutrition, Substance addiction, Physical activity, Stress management, Restorative sleep, Social support and Environmental exposure) and a total of 27 items.

The disease causes proliferation of destructive cells involving the lungs, skin, kidneys, and central nervous system.\n\nPatients ages 12 and older who have LYG and who are not pregnant, or breast feeding may be eligible for this study. Alpha interferon or chemotherapy, or both, will be used. Alpha interferon is a protein the body naturally produces. If patients have grade 3 disease, they will usually receive etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (EPOCH)-rituximab (EPOCH-R) chemotherapy (each letter representing a drug). If patients have grade 1 or 2 disease, they will usually receive alpha interferon. If patients have LYG after receiving alpha interferon and/or EPOCH-R, they may receive rituximab alone or with alpha interferon. Rituximab is an antibody, binding to a specific molecule cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) present on most B-cell lymphomas. Doses of several drugs in EPOCH-R may be increased if patients tolerated them in the previous cycle. If patients respond to EPOCH-R but still have low grade LYG, they may receive alpha interferon. Researchers will also try to obtain a biopsy of patient's lesions, to help in understanding the disease.\n\nPatients self-administer alpha interferon by injection under the skin three times weekly. They will visit the clinic every 2 to 12 weeks for follow-up. Patients will receive alpha interferon for 1 year after LYG goes away, depending on response. EPOCH-R has these drugs: rituximab by vein on Day 1; prednisone by mouth on Days 1 to 5; etoposide, doxorubicin, and vincristine as a continuous intravenous infusion on Days 1 to 5; and cyclophosphamide by intravenous injection over 1 hour on Day 5. Each cycle lasts 3 weeks: 5 days of chemotherapy and 16 days of no chemotherapy. Etoposide, doxorubicin, and vincristine are infused through a small pump worn by patients. The drugs are given over 5 days through a central intravenous catheter. There are two cycles of EPOCH-R beyond a maximum response, with six cycles maximum. To reduce harm to bone marrow, patients receive granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), self-administered by injection under the skin daily for approximately 10 days between chemotherapy cycles. If at the end of therapy, patients have a complete response, treatment will stop. If there is residual low-grade disease, patients may receive alpha interferon. Alpha interferon can have flu-like side effects of headache, fever, chills, and body aches. EPOCH-R drugs can cause gastrointestinal problems, hair loss, and weakness. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can cause bone pain, body aches, and hair thinning.

Though some studies have demonstrated an improvement, there have been conflicting results, as others do not seem to demonstrate beneficial effects. Furthermore, it is the combined application of rTMS with cognitive training that could represent a real turning point in interventions aiming to slow down cognitive decline resulting from AD. Research has shown that the best way to promote the strengthening of a network is to stimulate the area while simultaneously activating the network (i.e. through cognitive training) which supports the specific function of interest.\n\nRecently, there have been new protocols from animal model research showing that \"bursts\" of repetitive stimulation at a high theta frequency induce synaptic plasticity in a much shorter time period than required by standard rTMS protocols. This type of rTMS stimulation, theta-burst stimulation (TBS), is therefore even more compelling as a therapeutic intervention given that it includes the benefits previously ascribed to other rTMS protocols, but requires less administration time. Furthermore, studies conducted using both types of stimulation suggest that TBS protocols are capable of producing long term effects on cortical excitability that exceed the efficacy of those using standard rTMS protocols.\n\nThis project offers patients the possibility of accessing an innovative non-invasive, and non-pharmacological treatment. The goal is to evaluate the clinical efficacy TBS in patients diagnosed with mild cognitive decline (MCI) and AD, verifying if TBS in conjunction with cognitive training produces results better than those obtainable with only one of the two methodologies alone. Patients will be evaluated throughout the full scope of the treatment period, through clinical assessments and neuropsychological evaluations. We will examine neuroplastic changes by investigating the neural correlates underlying improvements using the multimodal imaging technique: TMS-EEG co-registration. A secondary objective will be to define the most effective stimulation protocol, verifying if TBS applied continuously (cTBS) or intermittently (iTBS) produces better behavioral outcomes. The results will be crucial to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms through which brain stimulation contributes to the promotion of neuroplasticity, and the efficacy of TBS combined with cognitive training."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Mild Cognitive Impairment"]}, "designModule": {"phases": ["NA"]}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "Experimental: Continuous TBS (cTBS)", "description": "Application of cTBS. cTBS will be applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left DLPFC).
